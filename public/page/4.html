        We aren't getting much sleep, but this has been the best experience of my life so
        far.&#160; I never thought I could love anyone so much.&#160; I've been trying hard
        to support Rachel and Anne as much as possible as we all figure out how to deal with
        each other.&#160; Here are some more pictures of Anne (and Rachel).

              <p>

    <p>
        Once in a while I get approached by a reporter (either local newspaper or national
        business magazine) to comment on some story.&#160; I'm really not sure why they&#160;approach
        a B list blogger like me (how long since I last posted?) but it probably has something
        to do with the fact that I'm one of the only bloggers that went from Microsoft to
        Google.&#160; If there is a story that involves Google and Microsoft, my name seems
        to come up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My standard answer to any requests like this is that I can't comment.&#160; Here is
        the mail I sent in response to a message last night: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>Hi XXX, 
    <p>
        As much as I would love to help you out on your story, it is probably best for me
        to not comment on stuff like this. I want to keep my discourse on Microsoft (especially
        compared to my current employer) as positive as possible. I'm afraid that any thing
        that I might say would come across as "Microsoft bashing." This isn't just the Google
        PR dept. talking either -- I really want to take the high road. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm sorry that I can't be of more help. Good luck with your story. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Joe 
    </p>
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
        The funny part is that <strong>talking to the media has absolutely no upside</strong> for
        me.&#160;If I had something important to say, I would much rather post it here on
        my blog and let people link to it and forward it around if they find it interesting.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Reasons to blog over talking to a reporter:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>My voice gets through unfiltered</strong>.&#160; No matter how hard they try,
            I've seen reporters misinterpret what I and others have said again and again.&#160;
            I'm sure most of them think that they are faithfully transmitting the meaning of the
            primary source, but they invariably change the meaning along the way -- in some small
            (or large) way.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>I want the link traffic</strong>.&#160; Flow is the currency of the blogging
            world.&#160; Talking to a reporter gets me no flow.&#160; Even when they mention my
            blog (rarely) they almost never link to it.&#160; It seems like they just don't get
            how the web works.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Talking to a reporter could get me fired</strong>.&#160; Google really doesn't
            want me talking to reporters.&#160; Blogging is walking a fine line that requiring
            a healthy dose common sense; but talking to reporters is suicidal.&#160; The problem
            again is that what the reporter writes isn't necessarily what you thought you were
            saying.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>No mountains out of mole hills.<em> </em></strong>Writing something on your
            blog that people find interesting enough to link to and pass around is hard!&#160;
            The real time web (new name for the blog-o-sphere) is a very hard filter.&#160; While
            the media can produce its own buzz, it takes real work and something truly interesting
            to make an impact on the much more democratic medium that is the true internet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So -- reporters -- feel free to send me email.&#160; I'll happily respond in a polite
        way.&#160; But don't count on getting any comments out of me that I'm not willing
        to share on my blog.&#160; And I'd much rather put them on my blog in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wasn't going to upgrade to Photoshop CS2 because I didn't think that I need it.&#160;
        But that was&#160;before I found out about the new support for High Dynamic Range
        (HDR) and 32 bits per&#160;channel floating point support.&#160; Michael Reichmann
        over at The Luminous Landscape has an <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/hdr.shtml">article</a> talking
        about the new "Merge to HDR".&#160; I was going to how current cameras only handle
        6 stops and all (and what a stop is) but Michael does a good job of that in his article.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm excited about this feature because I think that it will enable me to capture images
        that I haven't been able to before.&#160; I've often shot bracketed exposures with
        the thought that I would merge them together by hand later. The results rarely are
        as good as I imagined when I took the image.&#160; For instance, shooting a sunrise
        of a mountain where the top of the mountain is in the sun but the rest is in shadow
        can be very difficult.&#160; Having a tool that approaches this in a more methodical
        way is exciting.&#160; On top of this, I'm excited by the possibilities of this combined
        with panoramic photography.&#160; Wide angle and pano photography has a problem whereby
        you are taking in so much of a scene that you are much more likely to have parts of
        the image be very bright and others be very dark.&#160; One of the skills that I've
        been developing is the ability to pick a scene where I won't run in to these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, as great as the new Photoshop might be, there are other parts of the digital
        photography system that need to catch up.&#160; The first is on the display side.&#160;
        While the data in a photograph might contain lots of dynamic range, today's displays
        can't show it all.&#160; That is going to change over the next couple of years.&#160;
        On the software side, there is plumbing being laid to support 32bpp through the Windows
        desktop and to the video driver.&#160; (The 3D APIs and graphics cards are support
        a lot of this already because it can be useful in 3D rendering).&#160; The displays
        are going to get better also.&#160; Over the next couple of years, expect to see wide
        gamut and HDR screens coming out.&#160; Sunnybrook is one of the companies that has
        been pioneering this <a href="http://www.sunnybrooktech.com/hdr/index.html">LED based
        display technology</a>.&#160; Where&#160;normal LCD or CRT displays can get a contrast
        ratio of 300-400:1, they claim their LED technology can get 60,000:1.&#160; That means
        the bright spots are brighter and the shadows are darker.&#160; I haven't seen one
        of these displays myself, but I'm super excited by the technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other side that needs to improve is on the image capture side.&#160; I have not
        specific knowledge of any plans from any camera manufacturers, but it is obvious that
        the megapixel race is slowing down.&#160; We are reaching the limits of the glass.&#160;
        Another example is the fact that the new prosumer level Nikon SLRs are still only
        6 megapixel.&#160; It is clear that the camera makers are going to compete on more
        than just the <em>number of pixels</em>.&#160; They will start competing on the <em>quality
        of those pixels</em>. This is going to be very exciting.&#160; We are entering a world
        where digital cameras are not just&#160;matching the abilities of film cameras, but
        they are on the verge of surpassing them.&#160; A camera that can capture higher dynamic
        range and a wider gamut?&#160; Sign me up!
    </p>
    <p>
        The big question in my mind is the print making side of the equation.&#160; When I
        print my photos, I usually send them out (<a href="http://www.whcc.com/">WHCC</a>&#160;or <a href="http://www.westcoastimaging.com/">WCI</a>)
        to be printed on a Chromira printer.&#160; This is a printer that uses LEDs to expose
        regular photo paper.&#160; This photo paper is then printed traditionally.&#160; The
        gamut of these devices (and that of the ink jet processes) can be larger than current
        displays but is still fairly limited.&#160; The dynamic range of all of these output
        devices is pretty low compared to what can be done with an emissive display device.&#160;
        The bottom line is that the printing technology isn't keeping up with the rest of
        the system.&#160; What does this mean in the long term?&#160; I'm not sure but we
        will start to see a vast divergence between the quality of an image when displayed
        on a good monitor compared to they quality of an image when printed.
    </p>
    <p>
        It certainly is an exciting time for photography...

        Rachel (my wife for those of you not playing along at home) has been struggling to
        get parking passes for our cars.&#160; In our neighborhood in Seattle, you need a
        permit to park on the street for longer than 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        How hard can it be to get this pass?&#160;&#160;The <a href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/parking/parkingrpz.htm">website</a>&#160;says
        "to have an application mailed to you, please call (206) 684-5086."
    </p>
    <p>
        The response at that number: "We're sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is
        full"<br />
        Two days later: "We're sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is full."
    </p>
    <p>
        So Rachel decides that this isn't working and goes downtown, parks (no easy task)
        and treks up to the 37th floor of the Seattle Municipal Tower.&#160; Let me set the
        scene for you.&#160; There are two workers helping citizens with their Traffic Permit
        needs.&#160; There is a third that gets up to help Rachel.&#160; Then there is a rotund
        woman sitting next to a ringing phone.&#160; I wasn't there but I imagine that she
        had an unpleasant look on her face.&#160; Let's call her Bertha.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Rachel:</em>&#160;"I'd like to get my zone parking permit"<br />
        <em>Helpful Dude:</em> "Great!&#160; Do you have your forms filled out and your check
        ready?"<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em> "No.&#160; I tried calling to get the form but the voice mailbox
        was full."<br />
        <em>Bertha (who chimes in from her chair next to a ringing phone):</em> "Well it isn't
        full now."<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em> "I called twice and it was full both times."<br />
        <em>Bertha: </em>"I just emptied it.&#160; It wouldn't be full if you people didn't
        call so much."<br />
        <em>Rachel: </em>"The website instructed me to call.&#160; Why don't you guys just
        put a PDF of the form on the website so that people don't have to call?"<br />
        <em>Guy in next line: </em>"That sounds like a great idea!"<br />
        <em>Bertha:</em> "Nah, that would never work.&#160; People wouldn't know how to download
        it or they would screw it up and it would just create more work for us."<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em>&#160;"All right then.&#160; I'll just get my pass and be on my way.&#160;
        I see that I've done all that I can do here."
    </p>
    <p>
        Seriously folks, I can't make this stuff up.

        The <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/04/14.html#a238">20% BoF session
        at CFP</a> last night was fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most interesting thing for me was the questions about how 20% time works.&#160;
        Hopefully I can repeat some of them and the answers here.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How will this scale as Google gets bigger? </strong>I don't know.&#160; What
        I've seen of Google management is that they are committed to keeping the same atmosphere
        as the company grows.&#160; As problems crop up (and I'm sure they will) I'm sure
        that Google will look for "non-traditional" solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you track this?&#160; What if someone is spending 30% of their time
        on a side project? </strong>There isn't really official tracking of this sort of thing.&#160;
        It really comes down to trust of the employee.&#160; At the end of the day (or year)
        you have to list what you've accomplished for your review.&#160; If you've wasted
        your time then you have nothing to talk about on your review.&#160; Keep in mind that
        failures aren't the same as doing nothing -- valuable knowledge is gained.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you make sure that people are using the time wisely?&#160; How does
        this relate to the goals of the division/group/etc?</strong> Well -- that is just
        it -- you don't know if the time is being used wisely.&#160; You want the engineer
        to do what <em>he/she</em> thinks is the next big thing, not what management thinks.&#160;
        Most people want to do the next cool think that will fire people up both inside and
        outside the company and may end up making Google money.&#160; If you think that the
        best way for you to add value with your 20% time is to slack off and do nothing than
        that really speaks for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What is the goal for this?&#160; Isn't this just a morale booster? </strong>For
        some people I'm sure that this is just a morale booster.&#160; My impression, from
        the short time I've been at Google, is that 20% time is more than that.&#160; Most
        people want to add value by doing stuff that is far easier to do inside someplace
        like Google than anywhere else.&#160; My feeling is that I want to use the time wisely
        to add value in new and unexpected ways for the company.&#160; There is a pretty fluid
        path for these projects, if they show promise, to get funded with full time engineers.&#160;
        That path is critical if a 20% project ends up being super successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Where do you find 20% to spare? I can't cut 20% of my features or slip my
        project by 20%.</strong>&#160; I think that there is more time then you think.&#160;
        If you do "research"&#160;in&#160; a lightweight way like this perhaps you can take
        the time elsewhere.&#160; Also keep in mind that happy engineers are more productive
        engineers.&#160; And stop going to so many meetings -- and if you do have meetings,
        don't allow people to sit in the back and read their email.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What about using 20% time as a reward for exceptional performers?&#160; What
        about&#160;taking away&#160;20% time for&#160;those who don't use it wisely? </strong>I'm
        not a huge fan of these ideas for a couple of reasons.&#160; First, some of the best
        ideas come from people who are looking at something with fresh eyes.&#160; If we make
        it a reward it may be too late to capture that.&#160; As for punishing people, I would
        think that this would have a chilling affect.&#160; We want people to try wacky things
        that no one else has thought of.&#160; Having some missteps is bound to happen and
        we don't want&#160;people to be afraid to experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why 20%?&#160; Why not 50%? or 10%? </strong>I'm not sure.&#160; My guess
        is that either someone took it out of thin air or some math PhD at Google has a proof
        somewhere.&#160; If anyone reads this and knows I'd love to here the answer.

        <strong>How do you allocate the time?&#160; Is it one day a week?&#160; 1.6 hours
        a day? 2 weeks a year and a weekend a month? </strong>From what I've seen so far,
        it is up to the engineer to figure this out.&#160; People can save it up and use it
        a month at a time if they like.&#160; My personal strategy is to spend some a week
        or two really getting some momentum behind something and then switching to a more
        integrated schedule.&#160; As project hit shipping mode and such these things may
        take a back seat while the time accrues.&#160; Keep in mind that no one is watching
        over your shoulder with a stopwatch.<br />

        One thing that I want to emphasize (and it came up multiple times last night) is that
        a lot of this comes down to <strong>trust</strong>.&#160; One of the big parts of
        the secret sauce here is that Google really trusts its&#160;engineers and, from what
        I've seen, the engineers live up to those expectations.

        Wow -- <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/05/03/25/2129248.shtml?tid=217&amp;tid=8">Slashdot</a> <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/05/23/1737226.shtml?tid=109&amp;tid=185&amp;tid=187&amp;tid=190&amp;tid=201">again</a>.&#160;
        That is always fun.&#160; I'm always amazed at the flow and I love the influx of comments
        both on Slashdot itself and on my blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        One comment was from "Dave B" asking me to elaborate on some theories as to why C++
        hasn't developed the same set of libraries that other environments such as Perl, Python,
        Java, C#, etc. have.&#160; Here are a bunch of ideas.&#160; I have no empirical data
        but just gut feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
        First off, we must examine the philosophy behind different environments.&#160; I may
        be making broad generalizations here, but stay with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Java and the CLR (C#, VB.Net): "Make the easy things easy and make the hard things
            possible."&#160; These environments try to avoid the inherit complexity that C++ has.</li>
        <li>
            Python and Perl (and perhaps others that I have no experience with): "Make my life
            easier -- I don't want to spend more time writing this fast and dirty script than
            I have to".&#160; Above all else users here prize being able to get something useful
            done now.</li>
        <li>
            C++:&#160; "Give me all of the fundamental tools and building blocks and I'll do it
            myself."&#160; Power trumps all.&#160; Templates and the way that people use them
            are a great example of this.</li>
        <li>
            (I'm sure that there are more categories for things like Lisp and Smalltalk.&#160;
            Filling out that part of the list is left as an exercise to the reader)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With this difference in philosophy it is no wonder that there is such - ahem - diversity
        in the C++ library space.&#160; Here are some more thoughts.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There *are* good sets of libraries out there for doing stuff.&#160; One example would
            be <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a>.&#160; These have limited uptake I think
            for a couple of reasons.&#160; First, downloading and building these is a pain.&#160;
            They don't already come with your compiler.&#160; Second, these libraries are either
            laser focused on a specific area (libtiff?) or are more collections/algorithms base.&#160;
            Boost, for example, doesn't include an easy interface for dealing with zip files or
            for writing a single threaded select loop based network server.</li>
        <li>
            The C++ standards process is slow and ponderous.&#160; While there are downsides to
            these environments being controlled by a single entity or a focused group, but the
            end result is much faster advancement of the language/runtime/environment.</li>
        <li>
            There are so many ways to do things in C++ that invariably arguments come up over
            how to do something. Even within one company, people can't agree.&#160; For some reason
            C++ programmers seem to be more stubborn on a lot of these points.&#160;&#160;The
            result is that&#160;everyone just writes their own thing.</li>
        <li>
            It is way to easy to write super hard to use APIs in C++.&#160; Templates make this
            problem worse.&#160; If you do this stuff day in and day out you get to know it and
            it makes sense to you, but most C++ libraries are hard to use on a casual basis.&#160;
            I think that there is a disease where people think that it is their obligation to
            use templates in as confusing a way as possible.&#160; Any time a class has a templated
            base class, you are going to go right over the head of 95% of the developers out there.</li>
        <li>
            Opinions are divided around RTTI and exceptions.&#160; Code written to deal with exceptions
            doesn't interop well with code that turns exceptions off.&#160; Almost no one turns
            on RTTI.&#160; In any case, the result is that these are walls to reusing code.&#160;
            If you don't use exceptions you have to come up with your own error code space or
            use platform concepts like HRESULTs.</li>
        <li>
            Everyone likes to replace their allocator but there is no standard way to do that
            for various libraries.&#160; <em>If</em> library lets your replace the allocator it
            is usually something that has to be done on a library by library basis.&#160; So many
            problems would be solved if the CRT and language had a way to do global hooking of
            the malloc/free and new/delete at the link level.</li>
        <li>
            DLLs, shared libraries, compiler differences, differing STL support all make it harder
            to do things in a standard way.</li>
        <li>
            Windows doesn't have a good standard build system.&#160; The upshot is that libraries
            are only on Unix or the Windows build is cobbled together.&#160; Environments like
            Cygwin are really poor compromises.&#160; It would be better for everyone if the unix
            make/configure systems would be updated to work natively on Windows also. It isn't
            like Windows can change anytime soon without breaking the world.&#160; The MS compilers
            are now free -- the make system is really the only missing part now.</li>
        <li>
            Each codebase has its own way for deciding how header files are included.&#160; Figuring
            stuff like that out is just a headache.</li>
        <li>
            Lots and lots of different string types.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Does this hurt C++?&#160; Probably not -- it is just targeted at a different audience.&#160;
        When you need the power you need the power.&#160; If you have to hunt around for example
        code or a helper library and somehow jam it in to your build system and project then
        that is the price for playing the game.

    <p>
        The Google model of development is more than just information sharing and the ability
        to switch projects.&#160; Here are the important points as I've seen.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There is, by and large, only one code base at Google.&#160; This has many advantages.&#160;
            Most obvious is that it is really easy to look at and contribute to code in other
            projects without having to talk to anyone, get special permissions or fill out forms
            in triplicate.&#160; That is just the tip of the iceberg, though.&#160; Having one
            codebase means that there is a very high degree of code sharing.&#160; Need to base
            64 encode/decode something?&#160; No problem, there is a standard Google routine for
            that.&#160; Found a bug?&#160; Just fix it and check it in after getting it code reviewed
            by a documented owner.&#160; One of the reasons that environments like Perl, Python,
            C#, Java, etc. flourish is that they have large and well through out libraries of
            useful code.&#160; For a variety of reasons, C++ has never had this.&#160; (I could
            theorize but that would be off topic.)&#160; Google has solved this problem by building
            up a large library of well documented and easy to integrate code.&#160; This not only
            lowers the bar for new projects but makes it easy to switch projects as you don't
            have to learn new conventions.</li>
        <li>
            Switching teams at Google is a very fluid process.&#160; An&#160;engineer&#160;can
            be 40% on one project, 40% on something completely different and 20% on his or her
            own thing.&#160; That mix can be adjusted as project requirements change.&#160; Switching
            groups should also not have an affect on your annual review score because of arbitrary
            team politics.&#160;&#160;&#160;Joining a new group is more about find a good mutual
            fit then going through HR and a formal interview loop.&#160; When there is an important
            project that needs to be staffed the groups and execs will evangelize that need and
            someone who is interested is bound to step up.&#160; If it is critical to the business
            and no one is stepping up (I don't know if this has occurred or not) then I imagine
            it would go come down to a personal appeal by the management team.</li>
        <li>
            The intranet in Google is super transparent.&#160; Teams are actively encouraged to
            share the most intimate details of their projects with the rest of the company.&#160;
            This happens through tech talks, design docs, lunch table conversations, etc.&#160;
            When two teams are doing similar things, people start with the assumption that they
            must have their reasons and that the situation will be worked out in time.&#160; There
            isn't a huge push to over optimize and have only one solution for each problem.&#160;
            This means that there isn't an adversarial relationship between teams that can lead
            to long standing animosities and information hiding.</li>
        <li>
            There is a big difference between&#160;pet projects being permitted and being encouraged.&#160;
            At Google it is actively encouraged for engineers to do a 20% project.&#160; This
            isn't a matter of doing something in your <em>spare time, </em>but more of actively
            making time for it.&#160; Heck, I don't have a good 20% project yet and I need one.&#160;
            If I don't come up with something I'm sure it could negatively impact my review.</li>
        <li>
            The intrapersonal environment at Google is very energizing. When someone comes up
            with a new idea, the most common response is excitement and a brainstorming session.&#160;
            Politics and who owns what&#160;area rarely enter into it.&#160; I don't think that
            I've seen anyone really raise their voice and get into a huge knockdown drag out fight
            since coming to Google.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Can 20% time work at other companies? I'm sure that there are going to be others that
        try.&#160; However, I think that it is important to realize that it is a result of
        an environment and philosophy to development more than a cause.&#160; I don't think
        that it is something that can be imposed in an independent way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd like to stress that these comments are my own and aren't any sort of official
        word from Google.&#160; Please don't draw any grand conclusions of corporate strategy
        and such.
