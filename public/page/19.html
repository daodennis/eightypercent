    <p>
        I hate New York.&#160; It isn't just the Yankees.&#160; It is the snide attitude that
        nothing else matters.&#160; Dave Winer, today, has an <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/05/07#When:8:41:06PM">entry</a> today
        that smacks of the same self-righteousness:&#160; 
    </p>
    <blockquote>"Basically the rule is that success breeds envy, and envy isn't that far
    from hate." </blockquote> 
    <p>
        While I think that this sentiment is true, I think that the bigger reason that people
        hate him is that he is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=dsm+bipolar&amp;spell=1">Bipolar</a> whiner.
        I've never had an email exchange with him where he doesn't take his toys and go home.
    </p>
    <p>
        By Dave's own criteria, the only reason people hate Microsoft is because we are so
        successful.&#160; In the ancient <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews">essay</a> that
        he points to he makes this argument (with BillG) directly.&#160; However, he has changed
        his tune over the last couple of years.&#160; I'm pretty sure that he wouldn't write
        the same thing now.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "they only hate me because I'm successful" arguement may be some of why MS is
        such a focus for animosity, but I (and a lot of other people at Microsoft) think that
        the problem is deeper than that -- it is one of the ways the company has changed over
        the last couple of years.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        If Dave really beleives what he wrote, he is guilty of the same hubris of which he
        accuses us.

    <p>
        It is getting on to time for me to look for a new car.&#160; I was pretty settled
        on a <a href="http://www.bmwusa.com/site_layout/models/0328/0328_mdlPage.cfm">Z4 3.0i
        w/ SMG</a>&#160;but the new <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/FutureModelHomePage/0,3210,24842,00.html">350Z
        Roadster</a> is looking pretty sweet.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking at picking it up sometime in September, but I want to plan ahead.&#160;
        I was going to avoid the 350Z Roadster because of the typical new car feeding frenzy
        but it looks like availability might not be that bad.&#160; However, if I get the
        Z4, I can pick it up in Spartanburg, NC.

        I just feel sorry for <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2003/04/29/star_war.shtml">this</a> kid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, the story (23rd hand, probably) is this:&#160; This kid used a school camera
        to video tape his star wars fighting skills.&#160; He forgot to take the tape out
        and someone else found it.&#160; I've mirrored the original video <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/Star_Wars_Kid.wmv">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It wasn't long before somebody on the net remixed it by adding appropriate sounds
        and special effects.&#160; I've mirrored that <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/Star_Wars_Kid_Remix.wmv">here</a> also.

    <p>
        I was finally able to find time to put true WYSIWYG HTML editing into JoeBlogger.
        Here is a current screenshot:<br />
        <img src="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger3.JPG" /> 
        <br />
        Notice that there is no save button.&#160; Just start a new entry and hit Upload.&#160;
        It FTPs everything that has changed to your site on a background thread. If you don't
        hit upload, it will automatically save your unpublished entry.&#160; I really like
        the UI model with no explicit "save" functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        I stole the HTML editing control code (which is really a wrapper around IE's rendering
        engine: Trident) from <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn's</a> <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=ddc98753-6559-489b-a533-57034790a93a">BlogX</a>.&#160;
        He stole it from Nikhil Kothari&#160;who wrote it originally&#160;<a href="http://www.asp.net">ASP.NET</a> <a href="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/default.aspx?tabindex=4&amp;tabid=46">WebMatrix</a> project.&#160;
        The HTML -&gt; XHTML conversion code was written by Andrew Lin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that JoeBlogger is a very different project than BlogX.&#160; BlogX is a client/server
        solution that has the canonical data store on the server.&#160; It requires a ASP.Net
        server to run the server side part (Actually, you could probably write a different
        server that expose the same API, but you get the idea).&#160; JoeBlogger is a client
        side only solution that doesn't have <em>any</em> server side code at all.&#160; All
        of the pages are generated on the client and uploaded to the server.&#160; As long
        as you have FTP access to your web server (and almost everyone does) you are set. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in getting&#160;a look at the JoeBlogger source, let me know
        and I can give you an early drop of the source.&#160; I'll probably add some more
        features (and a decent setup) and then release it.

        I'd like to switch to a new ISP. Here is what I'm looking for: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Reasonable rates. I'm thinking ~$20/month tops. 
        </li>
        <li>
            ASP.Net hosting 
        </li>
        <li>
            500Mb to 1Gb of space. I'd like to be able to put a lot of pictures up there. 
        </li>
        <li>
            No frills support 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reasonable access to log files. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It seems like there are a ton of LAMP shops out there offering a deal like this but
        I can't find anything that will host ASP.Net. Anyone know anything I don't? Do i have
        to get a bunch of friends together and colocate a box? Most places look like they
        really rip you on extra storage space. If I can't find anything good then I may drop
        the ASP.Net requirement and do most everything client side and FTP static pages up
        like I'm doing now. 
    </p>

<p>Top of the 7th -- Ms score two more runs.  6-0.  Meche is at 72 pitches and Clemens is already gone at 106 pitches.
<p>Bottom of the 9th and it is still 6-0.  Can the Ms hold on?
<p>Yea!  The Ms shut out the Yankees.  Meche is the man of the match.

    <p>
        Version 0.9.0 of my upstreamer is released. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Download the MSI installer <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/FTPUpstreamer/FTPUpstreamer-0.9.0.msi">here</a>.
        The source is available <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/FTPUpstreamer/FTPUpstreamer-0.9.0.zip">here</a>.
        The license for both is a zlib type license. You can read it <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/FTPUpstreamer/License.txt">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Notes about the release: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            FTPUpstreamer is a utility to upload a local directory to a remote directory on an
            FTP server. It keeps track of the files that have been uploaded already and the last
            changed time on those files. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This is a beta release. Don't expect too much. I've only really tested this against
            one server (W2k3, I think). I've only tested the client on XP Pro. 
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no support for listing or deleting files on the server. If you want to do
            more sophisticated stuff you might want to check out a more fully featured FTP program.
            I've used <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/">SmartFTP</a> and it has worked well for
            me. 
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no support for automatic uploading yet. You have to hit the button. At some
            point I'll have it automatically scan for changes. I'll also make it minimize to a
            tray icon. I figured getting something out early is best. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The program requires the .Net framework v1.0. You can get this from Windows Update. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Your FTP password is stored in plain text.</b> The config file is something like
            "c:\Documents and Settings\Joe\Local Settings\Application Data\FTPUploadConfig.xml".
            I don't think the uninstaller removes this. There are some other data files in the
            same directory that will also not be removed. Buyer beware. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you have any problems go ahead and write me email at FTPUpstreamer at BedaFamily.com.
        If I'm not super responsive (I have a day job) you can always update the source yourself.
        If you send me deltas I'll try to integrate them. At some point I may put the source
        under some sort of project management like GotDotNet workspaces or Sourceforge.

<p>I think I'm going to evolve my blogging software some more over the next couple of weeks.  I want to add the following features:
<ul>
<li>True WYSIWYG HTML editing.  I'm still writing HTML directly.  I think that I'm going to steal whatever Chris has in BlogX.
<li>Stories.  I want to be able to easily do one-off pages.
<li>Content macro expansion.  I want to be able to name a page or an entry and have a friendly way to refer to it.  Radio does this (I think) by just looking at words in quotes.  I may do the same.
<li>Photo gallery.  Ideally I'd like to be able to dump a bunch of files in a directory and have it create thumbnails and generate gallery pages.  I'd also want a UI for dealing with this stuff:  Ordering files, adding descriptions, etc.  I've been using <a href="http://www.pbase.com">PBase</a> for a while now but I think I want a better client side UI.
</ul>
<p>Right now the UI for JoeBlogger is dead simple.  There is no "save" button.  Just a "New Entry" and an "Upload" button.  There is a calendar control for finding entries and a list for all of the entries for that day.  My goal is to keep it that simple as I add these new features.
<p>BTW, I still plan on finishing the stand alone FTP uploader first!
