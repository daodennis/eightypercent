        I must be getting old because every week I look forward to listening to <a href="http://www.kuow.org/swing_years.asp">The
        Swing Years and Beyond</a> on KUOW, our local NPR station.&#160; It runs from 7-12
        every Saturday and is always fun to listen to.&#160; I'm not an expert in the era
        or anything but Amanda Wilde (and Cynthia Doyon before her) always seem to hit the
        right note.&#160; When I got my Honda Element it came with a free trial for XM radio.&#160;
        They have a&#160;1930s big band/swing station but it just isn't the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't live in Seattle you can listen to their <a href="http://kuow.org/listen_live.asp">streaming
        feed</a>.&#160; No podcast/mp3 available though.
    </p>
    <p>
        My grandmother died recently and listening to this music always reminds me of her.&#160;
        One of the songs they played a couple of weeks ago was "Chattanooga Choo Choo."&#160;
        I can't hear it without thinking of her favorite joke (copied from <a href="http://www.dykerheights.com/jokes.html">here</a>): 
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
    <p>
        Roy Rogers had just purchased a new set of boots. Going out one day to check on Trigger,
        Roy stepped in a pile of ... well suffice it to say that Dale told him to leave his
        boots outside on the porch until he could clean them up. Roy did so and went inside
        for dinner. In the meantime a cougar wandering around on the property spied the boots,
        grabbed them up in his mouth and headed for the wilderness. Roy, seeing his new boots
        heading for the hills, pulled on a pair of old boots, ran out and saddled up Trigger
        and headed for the hills to cut off the escape path of the cougar. Several hours later
        Roy returned, new boots in hand and the cougar stretched over the back of Trigger.
        Dale looking at the scene in front of her said "Pardon me Roy is that the cat that
        chewed your new shoes?" 
    </p>
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
        There are just so many ways my daughter won't get this joke.

        Last night was the first time Annie slept through the night.&#160; We put her to bed
        around 8pm and it is now 6:20am and she is still asleep. We've been working over the
        past couple of nights to eliminate her&#160;late night&#160;feeding and help her to
        get back to sleep on her own.
    </p>
    <p>
        I mentioned to my wife this morning I feel like we discovered the lost city of gold.&#160;
        Even if it doesn't go like this every night it is good to know that it can be done.

        Here is a recent picture of our little babe:

    <p>
        The second thing that happened today is that we released <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html">libjingle</a> on
        sourceforge.&#160;Full details are up on the <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-all-way.html">Talk
        blog</a>&#160;and at <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-bells.html">code.google.com</a>.
        Sean Egan (of Gaim fame) packaged up the code that Talk uses to do p2p as a library
        for others to use.&#160; Hopefully this will start a flood of interoperable voice
        (and other p2p applications).&#160; So that anyone can use it the code is released
        under a berkeley style license. Sean put together some great docs on how to use the
        new library <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing to keep in mind -- we haven't harmonized the specs and libjingle yet.&#160;
        The goal is to have libjingle implement the spec as it matures.&#160; Right now it
        just interoperates with Talk and is pretty far from the Jingle docs that the JSF released.&#160;
        As the spec moves forward the code will converge.&#160; Most of the differences right
        now are syntax.&#160; For example the underlying technique for punching through NATs
        is unchanged and is an adaptation of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-06.txt">ICE</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've wanted to release this core part of the Talk application for a long time now
        and I'm super excited to see it happen. The combination of these new standards and
        the libjingle library should be pretty potent.&#160; And since&#160;Jingle can be
        used for more than just voice, I'm sure we'll see this stuff used in interesting and
        surprising ways that we never envisioned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Update12/17/2006: Clarified how divergent spec/code are and pointed to ICE.

        We've been working with the Jabber community to&#160;standardize the P2P protocols
        that we've built on top of XMPP/Jabber.&#160; This process has already been super

    <p>
        For serious portraits or low light situations, we've been taking lots of pictures
        of Annie with my Canon 20D.&#160; I also have a Canon SD300 for convience and video.&#160;
        The video modes on these small cameras are amazing!&#160; I can't see myself needing
        more than a couple minutes of video.&#160; Who needs a video camera for their kids
        these days? 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, dealing with the video out of these things can be tricky.&#160; I post my
        pictures to <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">smugmug.com</a> (if you sign up use
        my referrer coupon: <span class="title">aoVCSFuPXSipF</span>).&#160; I've got a plan
        that also lets me upload videos.&#160; The only format they take is MPEG 1 (for compat
        reasons)&#160;but the camera produces MJpeg AVI files.&#160; Converting these things
        can be trickier than you'd think.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is what I've ended up doing -- if someone else has a better solution let me know. 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download 'MPlayer-mingw32-1.0pre7.zip' from <a href="http://www2.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/win32-beta/">here</a>&#160;[7.8M].
            There are a lot of distributions out there but most of the older ones don't work for
            some reason.&#160; This one at least does something reasonable. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Unzip this into a directory.&#160; I put it under an MPlayer dir in my "program files"
            dir. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a batch file with this in it (call it <code>convert-avi.cmd</code> or something):<pre>@echo off
setlocal

set CL="c:\Program Files\MPlayer\mencoder"
set CL=%CL% -oac lavc -ovc lavc -of mpeg -mpegopts format=mpeg1
set CL=%CL% -af lavcresample=44100 -vf hqdn3d,harddup -srate 44100
set CL=%CL% -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg1video:keyint=15:vrc_buf_size=1000
set CL=%CL%:vrc_maxrate=2500:vbitrate=2500:trell:mbd=2:vrc_init_cplx=1000 
set CL=%CL% -ni -nobps 
set CL=%CL% -o %~n1.mpg %1
%CL%</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Call your brand new batch file with the <code>.avi</code> file you need to convert.&#160; It will
            create a file in the current directory with the same name but a <code>.mpg</code> extension.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This command line is totally out of control.&#160; I couldn't find a way to wrap lines
        in batch files so I did the environment variable trick.&#160; I got this via trail
        and error and I'm not sure what all of the options mean, but here is what I know it
        does: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Encodes as MPEG 1 into a .mpg file 
        </li>
        <li>
            Upconverts the audio to 44.1 kHz as that is the only freq I could get to work. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't do any resizing or framerate changes (leaves it at 640x480x30fps for my files) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses a fairly high bitrate to make sure the quality stays good 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For a 18.5 second video doing this compression (just to MPEG1 -- let alone something
        better) cut&#160;a 35M AVI file down to 5.5M.&#160; The only problem I haven't figured
        out is that the first frame is really pixelated.&#160; If you can figure it out you
        win my undying gratitude.&#160; Check out the docs&#160;<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/index.html#toc">here</a> or <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Bonus:</strong> You can rotate the&#160;video during the conversion with a <code>,rotate=90</code> on
        the after <code>harddup</code> on the -vf argument. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, check out a cute video of Annie <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Stuff/MVI_0478.mpg">here</a>.

        I <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/09/02.html">left Microsoft for
        Google</a> one year ago today.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've got to be honest; it was a little scary when I left.&#160; I started at Microsoft
        right out of college after two internships.&#160; Up until a year ago, the lion's
        share of my professional experience had been at Microsoft.&#160; Microsoft can be
        a very comfortable place (much less so since they've been cutting benefits).&#160;
        From the outside, I've also been able to look at Microsoft with different eyes.&#160;
        What I used to rationalize away now appears <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001835.php">absurd
        on the face</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is one year&#160;later and I'm sure that I made the right decision.&#160; I've
        been much happier over the last year at Google.&#160; I'm sure some of it was the
        excitement of just doing something different, but a lot of it really came from the
        energy of those I work with and actually <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249">shipping
