<P>In other news, <a href="http://aspnetweblog.com/">Scott Watermasysk</a> kindly offered to send me the source to his HTML editing control, pictured <a href="http://aspnetweblog.com/images/richeditor.gif">here</a>.  I'm scared of the legal implications of looking at others' source outside of MS.  He may still send me the binaries though and those are fair game.  One question Scott, where did you get the cool flat tab control?  It looks like the one VS.Net uses.

<P>ChrisAn <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/2003/02/06.html#a167">says</a> that I need to support permalinks.  This is part of the plan but I need to renumber my entries (as I have duplicates now!) and I want to think long and hard about what I want my permalinks to be.  I'd also like to do this only once so that I don't spam everyone using Syndirella or other RSS aggregators as my feed completely changes.
<P>Ideally I'd like to create a page per day or per week and have the permalink point into that.  However, I don't want to break links around midnight as I move back to Seattle at some point.  I think that I'm going to start storing a time zone with each of my entries and use that to adjust when figuring out which entries go in which days.  
<P>In some ways this would be easier with a server side solution as I would just have an archive page that takes the entry number as a parameter.  There are other advantages to the client side solution though.

<P>I'm moved in and have a cable modem set up.  I spent today buying all of that stuff you have to buy when you move. </P>
<P>But I think that I have everything that I need.  I should be working again tomorrow.  It was really amazing to me how fast everything went.  I moved out here, got a cable modem, bought and set up a wireless router, recieved my Cisco ATA for vonage and plugged everything in.  Everything worked flawlessly.</P>
<P>Oh, and it is nice to see my wife again too ;)  Time to go to bed.  I want to start getting up early so I can match Rachel's doctor schedule.</P>

<P>I meant to write this earlier but I got carried away working on JoeBlogger
<P>I'm moving to Boise for the next 5 months (back in July) to be with my wife.  She is a doctor and her residency takes her to Boise for a year.  She has already been out there since the beginning of July 2002, but it has been really hard being apart.
<P>I've worked it out with my management so that I can telecommute.  Everyone at MSFT has been super supportive about this.  I think that the whole thing is just amazing. I'm looking forward to being able to really crank on stuff without all of the interuptions of being at the office.
<P>Now all I have to do is avoid all of the "interuptions" at home

<P>This is a test of an entry generated in my tool.  I have to type in raw HTML right now, but everything appears to be working...</P>
<P>Here is a screen shot of the current UI:</P>
<IMG src="/Stuff/JoeBlogger2.JPG" >
<P>Things yet to do...</P>
<UL>
<LI> Use MSHTML for rich editing.  And switch back and forth in a reasonable way. (Does anyone out there have a simple example I can drop in here?  I'm not looking forward to screwing with all of the interop)
<LI>Automatic upstreaming
<LI>Allow changing of time on an entry
<LI>Deleting and other such management of an entry
<LI>Categories!
<LI>Work on my template to improve the look of my site
<LI>Multiple site management and site configuration.  A lot of stuff is hard coded right now.
</UL>
<P>I've also decided that storing the entries in an xml file per day is a bad idea.  The timezones will get you.  I store the timestamp on an entry using GMT but the XML file (which is used as input into the UI) is based on local time.  I also use localtime all over the place in the UI.  I'll probably move to a flat list of entries (one per XML file) at some point and just figure out the local day assignments at runtime.  This will map much better to a real database anyway.</P>

<p>Radio screwed the pooch and deleted all of my data.  That kind of put a rush on my own software.</P>

<P>Well, here it is.  It isn't much right now but I can load up my data and generate an index page and RSS feed.  I have to generate the xml files for entries by hand right now, but that will be one of the next things that I implement.  After that, I'll generate an archive.  The last thing I have to do before it will be usable is do an FTP upstreaming solution (similar to Radio, but one that doesn't hang)</P>

<P>Like I said -- .Net killed the Radio star</P>
