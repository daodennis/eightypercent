        I came back from my photo trip and started catching up on email and blogs.&#160; It
        looks like the Google Kirkland open house went well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The bigger news, in my mind, is the technical preview that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/avalon/avnov04ctp/default.aspx">Avalon
        guys shipped</a>.&#160; I'm going to have to download it and play around to see what
        all changed since I left. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was really hoping that they would get something out before the Longhorn beta.&#160;
        I'm sure this was a ton of hard work, but I think that it proves that decoupling Avalon
        and Longhorn was really the right decision.&#160; It will allow the Avalon guys to
        go full steam ahead. 
    </p>
    <p>
        BTW, <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn's blog</a> is a good place to start
        on some of this stuff.&#160; He has an app that you can download and play with.

    With the advent of our new office, a lot of people have been asking (via email or
    comments on the blog here) about jobs at the Kirkland office.&#160; For a variety
    of reasons, I really can't do much on the recruiting side.&#160; If I've worked with
    you and you don't work for Microsoft, feel free to drop me a line.&#160; Otherwise,
    your best bet is to send email to <a href="mailto:jobs@google.com">jobs@google.com</a> as
    specified <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/">here</a>.&#160; Even though Kirkland
    isn't listed there, I'm sure you can reference the office in any email you send. I
    wish I could be everybody's inside line, but I can't.

        I've been super busy at work for the last few weeks.&#160; We've been iterating on
        our stuff and have come up with some cool plans.&#160; Hopefully we can turn those
        into reality and ship them.&#160; I wish I could say more but I really can't.&#160;
        I think that one of the reasons that Google is so reluctant to speak publicly about
        what they are doing is partly to surprise the competition and partly so that we have
        the freedom to try stuff without committing to deliver it.&#160; There may be some
        stuff that never sees the light of day, but it is better than announcing it and then
        it never seeing the light of day.&#160; I think that this probably makes it easier
        to pull the plug on projects that just aren't converging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides work, some other things are going on that I think are pretty exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I've been helping to port <a href="http://enblend.sourceforge.net">enblend</a> to
        build and run natively under Windows.&#160; Enblend is a cool tool to help in the
        blending stage of making digital panoramas.&#160; My (limited) understanding of the
        mechanics is that it converts the images into the frequency domain to come up with
        an optimal blending mask.&#160; Sometime soon I'd like to start delving into the hard
        parts (Math) and get a better understanding of what is going on.&#160; Andrew (the
        guy who wrote enblend) just released version 2.1 out into the wild.&#160; Let us know
        if you have any problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, I'm going to be missing the Google open house (a rockin' party scheduled for
        Thursday night) so that I can take a trip down to Page, Arizona to shoot slot canyons
        and other various rock formations.&#160; I'm going to be doing a lot of panorama and
        digital mosaic work so look for some cool images soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        One interesting photography note: I've had one of my large pano's printed up pretty
        large -- about 40" x 25" (100cm x 64cm, for those of you of the metric persuasion)
        and have it framed and hanging outside my office.&#160; Even at that large size, the
        photo is tack sharp.&#160; It is really a lot of fun to make images that large.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh yeah, and Halo 2.

        <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2004/10/googles-kirkland-office.html">It's true</a> --
        Google is opening a development office in Kirkland.&#160; In fact, we are moving tonight
        into our new offices.&#160; So far there has been a small group of us working in some
        temporary offices.&#160; It is going to be nice to move into a more permanent space
        where we can actually talk about work in the hallways! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Other nice things about moving: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Someone else is going to get and stock the drink fridge.&#160; We've been doing it
            so far by assigning people to make Costco runs. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We'll have an espresso machine so we can all practice our barista skills. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Conference rooms we can use any time we want. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We can hang our own art on the walls. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Faster connection to the internet and to Mountain View. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <s>Google colored bean bags everywhere.</s> Apparently the company that makes the
            google beanbags isn't making them any more. I didn't ask as I assume this is a long
            and complicated story.&#160; Don't worry -- we'll have foosball instead. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Lots and lots of whiteboards. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Stay tuned for more details!&#160; We are planning an open house&#160;party so that
        Seattle knows we are here.&#160; I don't think we can <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/26.html#a8523">invite
        thousands of people</a> like Scoble is suggesting -- they just wouldn't fit.&#160;
        Unfortunately I won't be around for the party because I'm going to be out of town
        on a photography trip.&#160; I'm really&#160;disappointed&#160;I'm going to miss it.

    <p>
        I spent the last weekend in Chicago visiting my parents and my sister's family and
        her three adorable kids.&#160; (Hi Harper, Ellie and Tate!)
    </p>
    <p>
        We combined this trip with my wife&#160;Rachel's first marathon!&#160; We took the
        train downtown early on Sunday morning and got there in plenty of time for the start.&#160;
        It was a complete mob scene.&#160; There were 40,000 people signed up to run the marathon.&#160;
        It took Rachel 15 minutes or so to actually get to the start line.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I cut across the course and was able to see her run by at the halfway mark.&#160;
        I then took my time walking to the finish line so that I could try to catch a glimpse
        of her on the home stretch.&#160; I missed her there but was able to meet up with
        her in the park outside the finish.&#160; Right after she finished she collapsed on
        me and said that it was the hardest thing she ever did and also the best.&#160; That
        is something coming from someone who finished a medical internship.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm so proud of her running it!&#160; Now all she has to do is let her feet heal.&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        Interesting stuff:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everyone is timed with what is called a "champion chip."&#160; This is a little device
            that you tie on to your shoe that marks when you step on checkpoints along the course.&#160;
            They had 10 of these checkpoints total.&#160; I'm not sure what technology they use,
            but it seems to work pretty well.&#160; There would be no way to get an accurate time
            for 40k people without something like this.</li>
        <li>
            Right after Rachel finished someone in front of her called for a medic.&#160; A woman
            and her father had apparently just finished together when he collapsed on the ground.&#160;
            He was still talking but obviously dizzy and confused.&#160; Rachel introduced herself
            as a doctor and volunteered to help.&#160;&#160;She checked his pulse on his wrist
            and in his neck.&#160; If you have a pulse in your wrist, your blood pressure is at
            least 90.&#160; If it is in your neck it is at least 60.&#160; Since the man had a
            pulse in his neck but not in his wrist he had a blood pressure under 90.&#160; She
            sat with them until the medics arrived and he was wheeled away.&#160; We both hope
            everything is okay!</li>
        <li>
            There is a company that tries to take pictures of everyone.&#160; Apparently they
            just shoot away and try to sort it all out later.&#160; Last night when we checked
            the site they had finished going through 22% of the photos they had taken and had
            three pictures of Rachel online.&#160; I can't imagine dealing with that many pictures!&#160;
            I'm wondering if they have some sort&#160;of OCR system to read the bib numbers off
            the runners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I took some pictures but I haven't had a chance to sort through them yet.&#160; Hopefully
        I can put one or two up in the next couple of days.

      </h2>
      <span class="lead">Mon, Sep 27, 2004</span>
      <div class="readmore">
        <div class="post">
            <p>

    <p>
        Adobe announced today a new image format for storing raw camera data.&#160; Dubbed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/main.html">DNG</a>&#160;(for
        Digital Negative) this format is meant to be a common interchange for the fast proliferating
        collection of proprietary raw image formats.&#160; By some estimates there are over
        60 different raw image formats out there.&#160; Because of this, there are really
        only a couple of software vendors that can afford to get into the raw image processing
        game.&#160; It appears that Adobe hopes to level this playing field with this new
        specification. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand the significance of this, it is important that you understand how raw
        image formats work and why they are different.&#160; When most modern cameras (not
        using the <a href="http://www.foveon.com/X3_tech.html">Foveon</a> sensor) advertise
        take a picture, they have a grid of sensors.&#160; These sensors only measure intensity
        but not color.&#160; To capture color data, a color filter (called a Bayer filter)
        is placed over the sensor so that each little sensor only sees one color (typically
        Red, Green and Blue).&#160; That means that the camera only knows one color value
        at each pixel.&#160; This raw data is then processed using a set of complex algorithms
        to produce an image that has all the color information for each pixel.&#160; For each
        pixel in the raw data, these algorithms reconstruct the missing color data by looking
        at the surrounding pixels and <em>guessing</em>.&#160; Because of this guessing, there
        are multiple ways to process this raw data -- and there is the possibility that these
        algorithms and guessing will get better in the future.&#160; Because of this, all
        serious cameras offer a raw mode where the raw (or close to it) sensor data is saved
        in a special format and the complex demosaicing algorithms can be done later on a
        computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, raw images are fundamentally different from regular images in that they store
        raw sensor data before it has been processed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The rub comes with the fact that each camera manufacturer has a proprietary raw format
        (or two or three) and some generally crappy software for dealing with it.&#160; Companies
        like Adobe (with the Adobe Camera Raw plugin for photoshop) and Capture One have been
        waging a guerilla war to create products to read all of these formats.&#160; If Adobe
        can succeed in getting camera manufacturers to implement this format in their cameras,
        life for many photographers could become much much easier.&#160; But this isn't a
        sure thing.&#160; Camera manufacturers are very aware of the business benefits of
        lock in.&#160; They do it with lens mounts and with their software suites.&#160; Canon
        or Nikon may see their proprietary formats as an advantage in the marketplace.&#160;
        Nikon even charges for the software to convert its raw format while Canon and most
        other manufacturers provide it for free. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't gotten a read from my buddies in Microsoft imaging, but I'm hoping that
        DNG is a huge success.&#160; Assuming that Adobe doesn't try to assert its own proprietary
        control over the format (Postscript anyone?) it may just let the camera manufacturers
        concentrate on making cameras and leave the software development up to a third party
        marketplace. 
    </p>
    <p>
        [update: RichB points out that there is also an open source utility for dealing with
        raw camera data called <a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/">DCRaw</a> and
        built by Dave Coffin. Apparently Photoshop (and Capture One?) build on some of Dave's
        work.]

        to go to Thai Tom but the line was too long.

    <p>
        We talked about Google, Microsoft and the industry as a whole.&#160; Tip jars, Bush

        a little worse for wear from the long walk up there and back.

        1Ds Mark II</a>.&#160; This thing looks awesome!&#160; Features that stand out: 16.7
        MP full frame, fast startup time and a wireless transfer option.&#160; There is still
        a question if they improved the battery technology or not.&#160; Not bad for a&#160;mere
        $8k.&#160; The thing still looks super big and heavy.

        I would love to own one of these, but I can't see my self spending that much on what
        is really a hobby.&#160; Plus, in the spirit of sour grapes, it would probably be
        too heavy.&#160; I really can't complain because I just received&#160;the Canon 20D
        that I preordered a little while ago.&#160; Now I have to find the time to go out
        and shoot.

        Check it the article about Google hiring at the <a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/30438.htm">NY
        Post</a>.&#160; The mention me and this blog but of course don't link to me.&#160;
        This media stuff is pretty crazy.&#160; I don't think that someone like me moving
        around is really that newsworthy.&#160; I'm definitely not as high profile as <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/">Adam</a>.

        One correction:&#160; I wasn't <em>the</em> lead developer on Avalon, but rather one
        of many lead developers.&#160; The group is pretty big and my leaving, while I'm sure
        they will miss having me around, won't put the project in jeopardy or anything.

        They call new Google employees Nooglers.&#160; That was what I was last week when
        I was down in Mountain View.&#160; It was a pretty exciting week.&#160; I went to
        some training classes and got my computers set up and such.&#160; I spent quite a
        bit of time working and hanging out with other Googlers.&#160; Everyone was super
        smart and down to earth.&#160; I learned a lot and had a great time.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the week I got my Noogler hat (propeller on top, of course) at a company
        wide friday event.&#160; I've been digging in this week back in Seattle.&#160; I'm
        hoping that I can get my first checkin in by thursday.&#160; My only job now is to
        write code and ship product.&#160; That is about all I can say too :)
