        I finally got my <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/08/08.html#a197">LensBaby</a> and
        had a chance to play with it.&#160; It is a little tricky to get the hang of and not
        every photo is a winner, but you can get some super cool effects.&#160; Here is a
        quick sample:

              <p>

    <p>
        This morning I spend a couple of hours hanging out in the Redmond courthouse to contest
        a speeding ticket.&#160; I didn't get my act together enough to file for discovery
        so I couldn't put together a real defense.&#160; There appear to be two easy ways
        to beat a ticket around here.&#160; First the infraction might not have been filed
        on time.&#160; Second, your trail might not be speedy enough -- two months after the
        infraction, I think.&#160; Neither of these applied to me so I ended up getting a
        deferred finding (a sort of probation). 
    </p>
    <p>
        While I probably could have done this via mail, it was enlightening to watch how things
        work.&#160; First, your trial doesn't get scheduled really.&#160; You are grouped
        with all of the other cases to be covered that morning.&#160; You sit there from the
        beginning of the session until your name comes up.&#160; The judge presiding this
        morning worked it such that the actual lawyers got to go first and the rest of us
        schmoes representing ourselves go after that.&#160; It was interesting to see how
        much time it really took the lawyers to beat a case.&#160; It mostly was about finding
        a loophole and arguing it.&#160; The judge has some discretion as to how to interpret
        things but most of it is cut and dried.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The thing that really surprised me was that by the time my case came up there were
        no lawyers in the room.&#160; This included the prosecutor.&#160; I think it really
        sucks that you can be tried for an infraction without a prosecuting attorney even
        present.&#160; To me it is a slap in the face that the state wants to extort money
        out of me (via the traffic ticket) without even bothering to have somebody there to
        personally do the extorting.&#160; At least the mafia comes and collects in person.&#160;
        Apparently this has been fought over and gone to the Supreme Bourt (at least that
        is what the judge said)&#160;but I don't have the time to really dig in to it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, I would urge everyone to contest a ticket just once to see how it all
        works.&#160; Or just show up in Redmond courthouse courtroom two any morning and sit
        and watch.

    <p>
        A couple of buddies of mine (Avi and Ken) both have <a href="http://www.lomography.com/about/">Lomo
        cameras</a> that they shoot with.&#160; For the uninitiated, these are super low tech
        cameras that are mass produced in Russia.&#160; There is no autofocus but instead
        a choice of 4 (count 'em -- four) focus settings.&#160; These cameras are so simple
        and bulletproof, that using them is more of a philosophy than a tool.&#160; The whole
        idea is to experiment and play.&#160; On top of that, the lens isn't sharp corner
        to corner and it has quite a bit if vignetting.&#160; That's okay -- it adds to the
        Lomo look.&#160; If I still shot film, I would pick one of these up right away.&#160;
        I may pick one up anyway.&#160; In essence, these cameras are the anti-digital camera. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you aren't willing to go that far, there is the <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/">lensbaby</a>.&#160;
        I have one of these on order.&#160; This is a super simple lens for you SLR.&#160;
        It is a single lens attached to some flexible tubing.&#160; You focus by using your
        fingertips to move the lens in and out.&#160; You can also tilt the focus plane.&#160;
        This lens also has quite a bit of blur and vignetting.&#160; And it works on digital
        SLRs?&#160; This thing is so old school that you have to manually take it apart to
        change the aperture.&#160; Sure, you could get the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 lens cheaper
        -- and it has autofocus and an adjustable apature.&#160; But there is something cool
        about the look and feel of the images form this lens.&#160; Check out some of the
        photos <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/pages/gall_strong.php">here</a>.&#160; (I
        want to post photos but I don't want to steal anybody's images.)

    etc.)&#160; I also finially met Mr. Winer -- an interesting experience.
