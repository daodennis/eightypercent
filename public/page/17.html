        I got some email from someone who calls himself "RAD Moose" (blogs offline...) on
        an easier way to take a snapshot from a video file.&#160; This might come in handly
        later.&#160; Here it is: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download Movie 
        </li>
        <li>
            Open WindowsMovieMaker2 (feature not in WMM1) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Import Movie 
        </li>
        <li>
            Scroll thru movie in Preview Window 
        </li>
        <li>
            Select "Take Picture From Preview Window" item in Tools Menu 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Very cool!&#160; I'll have to download Movie Maker 2 and give this a try!

        I just don't get the excitement around 802.11a and 802.11g standards.&#160; Sure --
        5 times as fast would be nice, but in reality, I'm not using my wireless connection
        for anything that requires faster speeds.&#160; God knows my broadband connection
        can't keep up with 11Mbps.&#160; And if I do (like copying GBs of photos around) I
        just plug in to an ethernet cable. I know, eventually we'll get video on demand and
        all sorts of other high end services over these wireless links.
    </p>
    <p>
        802.11b strikes a great balance of speed and range.&#160; The build-out is happening.&#160;
        Why is the press trying to make such a big deal of it?&#160; Or is it not the press
        and there are people who are&#160;really excited about this stuff?
    </p>
    <p>
        (10Gb ethernet might be more interesting as this means the network is approaching
        bus speeds.)

        I was busting a gut on this.&#160; They even say "Moo" at the end.

    <p>
        (Getting that snapshot of the video was a total PITA.&#160; Because of video overlays,
        PrintScreen didn't work.&#160; I had to turn off all of the video acceleration features
        via the display control panel so that the video went through the normal display pipeline.&#160;
        Overlays suck -- and they don't work with a desktop compositor.&#160; <em>Hint, hint</em>.)

        I've been working on buying a new car recently.&#160; I'm going to buy a BMW Z4.&#160;
        As part of this I've started learning as much as I can so that I pick the right options
        (and the right car!) and get a good deal.&#160; As part of this I've been reading
        the <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/">online forums</a> up at roadfly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        BMW seems to have great customer service!&#160; Check out <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/forum.php?postid=3341488&amp;page=1">this</a> thread.&#160;
        This guy is having problems with the SMG transmission on his car.&#160; (SMG is "Sequential
        Manual Gearbox" and is similar to an F1 race car transmission)&#160; Notice <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/forum.php?postid=3350545&amp;page=1">this</a> response
        from a BMW customer service rep.

        I wish that we could give this type of support for Windows.&#160; Perhaps if we charged
        $40k a copy we could :)

        If it isn't apparent from other sources, I work for Microsoft.&#160; Obviously, I
        cant speak for the company, but I'd like to draw attention to some comments from Steve
        Ballmer in the recent memo that he sent to us.&#160; <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> has
        these comments <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/05.html#a3206">posted</a> on
        his blog and I don't want to see them get lost in the shuffle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SteveB wrote: "Many customers, MVP's, employees, and industry analysts have said to
        us that people would appreciate our innovations more and the value we deliver if they
        knew the company and its people better." and&#160; "To generate enthusiasm for our
        company and innovations, we must also communicate more broadly and in a more human
        and compelling voice." 
    </p>
    <p>
        In case you haven't noticed, this blog (and many others) are a grassroots effort from
        within the company to do just what Steve is asking.&#160; What would you like to see?&#160;
        How do you think that we can execute on this mission of transparency? 
    </p>
    <p>
        In my opinion, we have a long road ahead to dig ourselves out of the hole that we've
        dug.&#160; Engaging with the community in a real way is one step.

        <a href="http://www.neelbubba.com/">Bubba</a> has some <a href="http://www.neelbubba.com/Thesis/Archive/2003_05_01_index.php#95045729">interesting
        ideas</a> around subscribing to an entire site instead of just "news."&#160; He is
        doing his Master's thesis on blogging so he has been spending a lot of time thinking

        RSS is a part of the puzzle but only captures a part of what is on a site.&#160; What
        would you need to move in to the post browser era? 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A "site.xml" file to describe the type of content available at the site. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This could point to a set of blogs available on that site.&#160; Bubba (and a lot
            of others) expose more than one blog, or view of their blog.&#160; Perhaps this is
            just a pointer to an RSS file. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Included in each RSS file a pointer to the archive for that is important too.&#160;
            Winer has some stuff on that a while ago that could easily be integrated here. 
        </li>
        <li>
            A reference from the "site.xml" file to other resources available on that site.&#160;
            This could include a list of "stories" and photo galleries.&#160; Perhaps specific
            pages like a disclaimer/license page, a contacts page, etc. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We could use XHTML for all unstructured content that isn't covered otherwise. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is an incremental&#160;start on the semantic web.&#160; If we start with XHTML
        and start pulling stuff out on a piece by piece basis we can start to reduce the amount
        of unstructured content. 
    </p>
