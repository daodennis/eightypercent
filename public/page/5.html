        Okay -- when people <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jbeda/231/#231881">ask
        me</a> to update in my comments it has probably been too long. I don't have anything
        super pithy to say, so I guess I'll just use the shotgun approach: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everything is going good with the baby.&#160; Rachel is starting to get big!&#160;
            We are reading to her every night and trying to get our lives in order so that we
            are ready.&#160; We are almost through "The Witch and the Wardrobe." We've been reading
            a chapter each night.&#160; After we are done we will continue reading the rest of
            the <a href="http://www.narnia.com/">Narnia</a> stories out loud&#160;to each other
            and the baby.&#160; I know she can't understand what is going on but I want her to
            know my voice. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We went to Chicago last weekend.&#160; My Sister threw Rachel a baby shower at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/chicagorc/">Ritz-Carlton</a> downtown.&#160;
            The service in the garden was wonderful.&#160; My sister's two girls had an especially
            great time. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I've been buying some cool stuff.&#160; The first is my <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/28.html#a224">terabyte
            array</a> for my main computer.&#160; I ended up with five 300GB SATA drives in a
            cage running software RAID 5.&#160; That comes out to ~1.2TB after you factor out
            the redundency.&#160; I didn't get a dedicated machine to keep costs down.&#160; I
            can always do that later and move the drives over.&#160; Everything has been running
            like a champ. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Also to prepare I picked up a Canon <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=145&amp;modelid=10599">SD300</a>.&#160;
            This is an update to our aging <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/s100.html">S100</a> (the
            original digital Elph) point and shoot.&#160; It is amazing how much these things
            have improved.&#160; I loved the S100 but the SD300 is <em>so</em> much better.&#160;
            My favorite feature is that it can do 640x480x30fps movies until the card is full.&#160;
            For short clips there is no reason to get a video camera.&#160; I also ordered a 1GB
            SD card but those are apparently sold out everywhere. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm thinking about getting a new car as the baby approaches.&#160; I want to take
            a serious look at the <a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/models/model_overview.asp?ModelName=Element">Honda
            Element</a>.&#160; Having an interior made of rubber that you can hose down sound
            like a good idea with kids. Plus, it is only $21k completely decked out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Between Rachel and me, we've recently read the entire <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=raymond+chandler">Raymond
            Chandler</a> catalog.&#160; I love his writing.&#160; You can just feel vintage LA
            ooze from the pages. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I haven't been taking many photos lately.&#160; I have some more stuff&#160;from the&#160;<a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/27.html">Arizona
            trip</a> that I should post.&#160; I haven't put up any of my slot canyon photos yet.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Work has been going great.&#160; I still can't talk about what I'm working on but
            I really feel like I've made it over the hump of moving to a new environment and I'm
            starting to be really productive.&#160; The contrast between Google and Microsoft
            couldn't be greater (at least from an engineer's point of view).&#160; No meetings
            and few politics means that I spend much more time coding.&#160; I've written more
            code so far at Google than I have in the last year at MS.&#160; (That really isn't
            apples to apples as I spent most of my time in the last year at MS writing specs.)&#160;
            I totally feel like I'm in the loop on my project without having to play political
            games.&#160; I guess that is what happens on smaller teams. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'd love to have some intelligent comment on the whole <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/static.py?page=features.html">AutoLink</a>/<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=smarttags">SmartTags</a> thing
            as I've been around for both.&#160; However, I just don't see a clear cut answer here,
            unlike some.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, <a href="http://uploads.ungrounded.net/content.php?id=206373&amp;name=206373_numanuma.swf&amp;title=Numa%20Numa%20Dance&amp;date=1109739600&amp;quality=b&amp;uj=0&amp;w=500&amp;h=375">Numa

        Good news!&#160; We are having a baby.&#160; My wife is pregnant. I know that people
        usually say "we are pregnant" but she is the one that went through the nausea and
        has to deal with carrying the baby around for 9 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ultrasound from this morning looks good.&#160; It is still pretty early yet (she
        is 17 weeks along -- due date is June 21st) but the ultrasound tech said that it looked
        like our baby is a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I have to figure out how to be a father!

    <p>
        Here is a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">Raymond</a>-esque tidbit that
        I wanted to get out there.&#160; I couldn't find anything on Google and had to figure
        this stuff out via trail and error. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay -- you think you know how to escape stuff on the DOS/Windows command line?&#160;
        Probably not.&#160; Let's start with a simple python script to show us what we've
        got: 
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;type dumpargs.py
# a simple program to dump the incoming arguments
import sys
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    print repr(arg)
</pre>
    <p>
        Now lets run some tests and see what it spits out: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there"
'hi there'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi \" there"
'hi " there'</pre>
    <p>
        So far so good. It looks like we know how to escape a double quote sign ("). But what
        about the pesky percent sign? DOS/Windows/Command/CMD uses this for variable substitution.
        Let's try a bunch of stuff and see what we get: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;set foo=bar

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there %foo%"
'hi there bar'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \%foo\%"
'hi there \\%foo\\%'</pre>
    <p>
        Hmmm, it looks like the backslash doesn't work. Looking around, it looks like the
        caret symbol (^) is the way to go. Lets try that out. 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py ^%foo^%
'%foo%'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there ^%foo^%"
'hi there ^%foo^%'</pre>
    <p>
        Well, it looks like that works as long as it isn't in quotes. I also found another
        wacky case: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \" ^%foo^%"
'hi there " %foo%'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \" \" ^%foo^%"
'hi there " " ^%foo^%'</pre>
    <p>
        Very odd -- it looks like the caret does work as an escape character as long as there
        is an odd number of escaped double quote characters before it in the string. The parser
        here is obviously not a simple as one might first think. Lets try ending the string
        before we quote the percent sign: 
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi there %foo% bar'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi \" there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi " there ^%foo^% bar'</pre>
    <p>
        We are getting closer, but that escaped quote character puts the parser into a wacky
        state. I finally did find a good solution: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi "^"" there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi " there %foo% bar'</pre>
    <p>
        It turns out that you must replace the double quote (") with the following sequence:
        "^"". You must also quote the percent character (%) with this sequence: "^%". I think
        that everything else is okay inside of the double quotes. Very strange but true. I
        guess this is what 20 years of back compat get you.

        This was a pretty lean day on the workshop.&#160; This was our day to go and hike
        out to "the wave."&#160; The Wave is a really cool set of sandstone rock formations
        buried in the north part of <a href="http://www.az.blm.gov/paria/cbusereg2.html">Coyote
        Buttes</a>.&#160; A permit is required to hike Coyote Buttes and the BLM restricts
        it to 10 people per day.&#160; The problem is that on the weather had taken a turn
        for the worse during the night.&#160; When we work up at 5 AM on Sunday, it was raining
        in page.&#160; As we drove toward the trailhead we gained elevation and it started
        snowing.&#160; Around 6 AM we needed to start driving on gravel roads.&#160; It was
        still snowing pretty hard and we decided to turn back.&#160; I was looking forward
        to a good hike and was disappointed that we didn't make it to the Wave. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When we got back to the motel, we picked up everyone else and went "hunting."&#160;
        Off the side of the road outside of Page, as we were climbing, we stopped to photograph
        some fresh snow on desert trees.&#160; This is one of the images that resulted. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical details: Original composition was 24 images (8x3).&#160; I cropped out just
        a corner of that to make the composition as seen above.&#160; Total images used then
        is probably more like 15 (5x3).&#160; Each was shot at 1/25 sec, f/11, ISO 100 with
        the 24-70 f/2.8L @ 50mm.&#160; Final image is 6000x6000 or 36 megapixel.

    <p>
        I know it seems hard to believe in this day and age of 300GB hard drives, but I've
        run out of hard drive space.&#160; My plan up until now was to keep a bunch of stuff
        on a <s>RAID 0</s> RAID 1 (RAID0 is simple striping with no redundency. RAID 1 is
        mirrored.) 120GB set of drives.&#160; As that fills up, I've been archiving stuff
        to DVD.&#160; The problem is that I've had to start archiving stuff sooner than I
        thought and I don't trust the DVDs.&#160; In fact, I've gotten read errors on some
        already.&#160; They may be fine for video, but I don't want to archive data on them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm faced with a couple of options.&#160; The first option is to half ass it some
        more and put a couple of more drives into my current computer.&#160; I'm hoping the
        power supply can take it.&#160; I think I can fit them in there but it may be tight.&#160;
        Thank god for serial ATA at least.&#160; I don't think I could fit them in with regular
        old parallel ATA.&#160; A Maxtor 300GB SATA drive is urrently $206 at newegg.&#160;
        300GB more (mirrored) would be a good start, but I'm sure I'd run out of space sooner
        or later. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The other options I was thinking about was putting together a storage server and running
        RAID 5 (stripe set with parity -- it spreads the data across multiple drives but duplicates
        some of the data for redundency).&#160; I'd like something that I can grow with so
        I'd like to be able to increase the amount of space for just the cost of more drives.&#160;
        Here is what I came up with: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Computer guts: 
            <ul>

                    PCI support. This is the cheapest motherboard with 64bit PCI support I could find.&#160;
                    It also comes with SATA RAID on board if I need it.&#160; Dual gigabit ethernet --
                    yum.

                    good price for a fast processor.&#160; Since I'm going to be doing RAID 5 in software
                    it seems worthwhile to pay for a decent proc.

                    It comes with a fan and a "backplane" for all of the drives.&#160; And you get cool

                    That should be enough to get me started.&#160; It uses the host processor for doing
                    the RAID 5 stuff, but it is a lot cheaper than the cards that do RAID 5 in hardware.&#160;
                    Since I'm not all that concerned with speed, the savings should be good enough.&#160;
                    The <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=16-125-005&amp;depa=0">Broadcom
                    card</a> is another option but it is $100 more.&#160; Tom's hardware did an <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/storage/20041006/index.html">interesting
                    expriment</a> with these where they drove 32 drives off of one computer.

                    This seems to be a sweet spot in capacity right now. The 250GB drives aren't that
                    much cheaper and the 400GB drives are super expensive.&#160; The Maxtor also comes
                    with a 3 year warranty.

    </ul>
    <p>
        Total price: <strong>$1913</strong> plus shipping and software.&#160; I'd probably
        run Windows as I think I have a legit copy of SBS 2k3 that MS gave me when I still
        worked there.&#160; It should run Linux fine too if all you want to do is serve files. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With RAID 5 this will give me ~900GB of redundant storage.&#160; I can easily double
        the size with another hard drive cage and a set of drives ($942).&#160; This seams
        like a pretty wild deal to me.&#160; Sure it won't be the fastest thing out there
        but it is pretty darn cheap for a ton of storage.&#160; I probably won't drop the
        money on something like this for a while, so I'm expecting it to just get cheaper. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, am I missing anything?&#160; Is someone going to come out with a turnkey system
        for half the price?&#160; The closest comparable thing I could find where the NAS
        systems that various people are selling.&#160; Nothing could touch this setup on price.&#160;
        I looked at the Apple XServe (I do love blinking lights...) but they start at $6000
        for 1TB and require fiber channel.&#160; Way overkill for me.&#160; There is also
        something like the <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10462">LaCie
        terrabyte drive</a>&#160;($1000).&#160; This seems like an amazingly bad idea to me.&#160;
        They must 4 drives in there.&#160; If one fails you loose all of your data.&#160;
        The chances of loosing all of your data is 4 times as likely. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I like pricing out stuff like this even though I may never buy it :)

    <p>
        Last weekend I spent some time down near Page, AZ photographing some beautiful southwest
        scenery.&#160; Since I don't have the time or experience to plan something like this
        myself, I went with a group of people led by <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/about.htm">Steve
        Kossack</a>&#160;from <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/">f-8 and be there</a>.&#160;
        Steve takes people out on photography workshops to places that he knows very well.&#160;
        It is&#160;amazing what a difference an experienced leader can make to an expedition.&#160;
        I had a great time and got some amazing images from the trip. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My flight to Phoenix on Thursday got in around 1:30 pm.&#160; Steve and some of the
        other participants picked me up at the airport baggage claim.&#160; We were then immediately
        off on a pretty long drive up to Page.&#160; Page is right on the border between Arizona
        and Utah.&#160; It's on <a href="http://www.powellguide.com/lakepowell/lakepowellmap.html">Lake
        Powell</a>, a huge serpentine lake made by the Glen Canyon Dam.&#160; The Glen Canyon
        dam is on the Colorado upstream from the Grand Canyon. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once at page, we checked in to a hotel and started our 3 days of intense field photography.&#160;
        A typical day would be getting up early enough so that we could be at a good spot
        for sunrise.&#160; Up in the high desert this was pretty cold this time of year.&#160;
        Lows at night were somewhere around 35-40 degrees F.&#160; We would then photograph
        the sunrise.&#160; After that we would spend the day in locations that work well with
        overhead light.&#160; For this trip we photographed both upper and lower Antelope
        Canyons.&#160; These are amazing slot canyons that really have to be seen to be believed.&#160;
        As the day wears on we would travel to another amazing location for a sunset shoot. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides the wonderful landscapes, the other people on a trip like this make it a very
        enriching experience.&#160; It is refreshing to me to be out with people who enjoy
        photography so much.&#160; It takes a certain type of person to get up at 4:30am in
        the cold so that you can travel two hours to be in time for the morning light.&#160;
        One part of the workshop that I particularly enjoy is the print discussion.&#160;
        Steve encourages everyone to bring some prints of their work.&#160; Then, after living
        with each other for a couple of days, we get together to admire and discuss each others'
        work.&#160; Steve also brings some of his best work for us to look at. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in an experience like this and have&#160;a passion for photography,
        give Steve a call.&#160; His upcoming <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/workshops/rafting05.htm">Grand
        Canyon rafting trip</a> looks like a trip of a lifetime.&#160; I won't be able to
        make this one, but it looks like he has a couple of spots left. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the images that I got -- here is a start: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Horseshoe Bend at dawn" hspace="0" src="http://www.eightypercent.net/photos/HSB-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /> 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is famous Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado river.&#160; The river&#160;carves a
        perfect circle as seen from&#160;the cliff overlooking the canyon.&#160; This was
        our first sunrise of the trip.&#160; I'm always a little rusty when starting out on
        something like this, but I'm happy with this result.&#160; The mountains in back (catching
        the sun first) are called the Vermillion Cliffs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical details: 20 images stitched together (3x7) shot from my Canon 20D with the
        24-70mm f/2.8L at 34mm.&#160; Exposure was 1/25th second at f/11 and ISO 200.&#160;
        I haven't done the full stitch yet (this is a small version) and so I don't know the
        final resolution. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Look for more images in the coming weeks as&#160;I sort through the boatload of data
        I captured.&#160; As a point of reference, I ended up with ~14GB of raw data from
        this trip.&#160; I'm going to run out of disk space!
