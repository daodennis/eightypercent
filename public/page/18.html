    </blockquote> 
    <p>
        Actually, reaching way back into my memory, I seem to remember that we had, or almost
        had, a feature like this in IE4.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The story goes like this: starting with IE4 we switched over to the new advanced Trident
        rendering engine (mshtml.dll). We worked super hard to be compatible with all of NS3's
        quirky behavior.&#160; One thing that our architecture made it very hard for us to
        handle is the case where someone had both a &lt;frameset&gt; and &lt;body&gt; on the
        same page.&#160; Netscape handled this one way and it was really hard for us to do
        the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer that we came up with at the time was to have an "analyze" dialog that would
        look at the page and tell you why it wasn't doing what you wanted it to do.&#160;
        I don't think that anything really came of it and it was pulled at some point.&#160;
        The particular markup behavior that pushed us toward a solution like this disappeared
        from the web as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This wasn't a true "validate" dialog at such, but the push for pure wasn't there back
        in 97.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not making any excuses here, but I think that everyone can agree that one of the
        reasons that IE was so successful at that time was because it could consume everything
        that was already out there on the net -- and that meant very careful duplication of
        all of netscapes bugs.

            WinHEC (a Japanese site, no less!), you can see KerryHam's hands.&#160; Kerry is one

            I'm working to help design (along with a bunch of others -- <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> included)a
            set of APIs that we haven't made public yet.&#160; Stay tuned for the PDC to see what

            I don't hate all New York.&#160; It is too big a place for that.&#160; I definitely
            don't like the Yankees, though.&#160; A while ago I read an article in the NY Times
            Sunday Magazine that basically said, "Why is Washington, DC, the capitol of the US
            when everyone knows that NY is the true center."&#160; I guess that a few experiences
            like that has tained me.</li>
        <li>
            I'm really excited about the server and what we can do with it.&#160; For instance,
            I'd love to have a real CVS server.&#160; (GDN workspaces only lets you check out
            one file at a time and SourceForge isn't very MS friendly...) I know someone else
            who (I think) is doing something similar to my co-op idea, but I don't want to "out"
            him.&#160; If anyone has experience doing this stuff, I'm all ears.&#160; This could&#160;
            become a pretty popular model for stepping up from a regular web hosting type account.</li>

    <p>
        Instead of switching to a new ISP, I'm thinking of getting a bunch of friends together
        and buying a box and colocating it.&#160; Here is how the math works out: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1U server hosting: $100/mo.&#160; There are a couple places in seattle that i've found
            that offer this kind of deal.&#160; $100 seems to be the starting price. 
        </li>
        <li>
            1U server: ~$1200.&#160; This all depends on how much you want to spend.&#160; Since
            there won't be someone backing this stuff up for us, a RAID mirroring config is probably
            best.&#160; It looks like <a href="http://www.ironsystems.com/">iron systems</a> might
            have some decent machines.&#160; I spec'd out a 1.47GHz Athlon w/ 256MB of memory
            and 2 160GB disks w/ HW RAID for $1200. 
        </li>
        <li>
            OS: Install something free or step up to Windows 2k3 :)&#160; Being a MS employee,
            I can get a deal.&#160; This could be an extra $1000, depending.&#160; When the web
            edition is released it will probably be a lot cheaper. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        So, assuming that I can get 5 people together on this total, the start up cost will
        be $250-$450 each.&#160; The montly cost will be somewhere around $20 each.&#160;
        With 6 people, we can get the startup cost down to $200-$360 each.&#160; I'd probably
        want to charge more per month so that there is an ongoing slush fund for machine upgrades
        and fixes and such. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding SQL server is another $5k.&#160; Chances are I won't need anything that industrial
        strength.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, for a very reasonable price ($450 + $20/mo) you can get your very own W2k3 machine
        in a data center that you can do anything you want to.&#160; BTW, 160GB is a ton of
        disk space to have on the net.&#160; Beyond this, you also have to worry about back
        ups and applying the latest security patches... 
    </p>
    <p>
        Has anyone out there done this?&#160; How is it working out?&#160; Words of advice?

        Once you've installed the binaries, there is a readme on what to do next installed

        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Config/Site1.Config</code> is a private config
            file with various file paths and FTP server information. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1</code> is everything that gets uploaded
            to the server.&#160; This includes the raw XML source data and the generated html
            files.&#160; If you have images or other files in that directory also, they will get
            uploaded for you. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1/Config/Site.Config</code> contains public
            config information. 
        </li>
        <li>
            When publishing the client generates the site into the <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1</code> dir
            and then uploads that to the FTP server. 
        </li>
    </ul>

        I hate New York.&#160; It isn't just the Yankees.&#160; It is the snide attitude that
        nothing else matters.&#160; Dave Winer, today, has an <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/05/07#When:8:41:06PM">entry</a> today
        that smacks of the same self-righteousness:&#160; 
    </p>
    <blockquote>"Basically the rule is that success breeds envy, and envy isn't that far
    from hate." </blockquote> 
    <p>
        While I think that this sentiment is true, I think that the bigger reason that people
        hate him is that he is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=dsm+bipolar&amp;spell=1">Bipolar</a> whiner.
        I've never had an email exchange with him where he doesn't take his toys and go home.
    </p>
    <p>
        By Dave's own criteria, the only reason people hate Microsoft is because we are so
        successful.&#160; In the ancient <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews">essay</a> that
        he points to he makes this argument (with BillG) directly.&#160; However, he has changed
        his tune over the last couple of years.&#160; I'm pretty sure that he wouldn't write
        the same thing now.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "they only hate me because I'm successful" arguement may be some of why MS is
        such a focus for animosity, but I (and a lot of other people at Microsoft) think that
        the problem is deeper than that -- it is one of the ways the company has changed over
        the last couple of years.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        If Dave really beleives what he wrote, he is guilty of the same hubris of which he
        accuses us.
