<P><a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx?guid=b6b07998-429a-4bbf-a49e-8fa7f9af4a30">Chris</a> recommends <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=68CELOCOM7&isbn=0375756787&itm=1">The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</a>.  I'm reading this right now and probably about 3/4 of the way done.  I'm also amazed at the productivity and veriety of experiences this man had at so young an age.  It really drives me to get off of my ass and do something.
<P>A few weeks ago I finished <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=68CELOCOM7&isbn=0385495404&itm=1">The First American</a> by H. W. Brands.  This is a biography of Benjamin Franklin.  I'd also highly recommend it.  Again, this is someone who went out and created his own destiny.
<P>In reading these two back to back, you can't help but see the contrasts.  Roosevelt was the jock intellectual, Franklin was the geek of his time.
<P>I love american history.  In college I took quite a few courses on 20th century american history.  In the last couple of years I've started reaching back a little further.  It is just so amazing to me to make the connection between now and say, 100 years ago.  When you start reading these histories, time tends to compress and a century is a lot closer than it appears.  Hell, a little over <S>100</S>150 years ago we were invading Mexico (Mexican/American War).

<P>I'm busy getting my FTP support up and working.  Learning all of this new stuff is fun.  I'm working directly off of <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc959.html">RFC 959</a> and looking at the debug log stuff in SmartFTP.
<P>So far I can connect, log in, create a passive connection and list the root directory.  Once I have enough support to upload a file (real close now) I'll be set.  I probably have another hour or two to get that working.
<P>However, I'm going to be travelling back to Seattle the rest of this week so I won't be able to work on my little tool here.

<P>So, <a href="http://michaelw.net">MichaelW</a> invited me to the Montreal F1 races this summer.  I would love to be able to go but it is just too much money. I haven't been at Microsoft as long as Michael has...
<P>Instead, I'm in the process of trying to sign up to go on <a href="http://luminous-landscape.com/workshops/sk-dv-work.shtml">this photo workshop</a>, led by Steve Kossack.  This will be the first of this type of trip that I will have gone on.  It still isn't cheap but looks to be in line with similar excursions.  It also isn't <a href="http://luminous-landscape.com/workshops/africa-ws.shtml">this trip</a>.

<P>Ha, I just read Michaels <a href="http://michaelw.net/Articles/Idontgettheweblogcalendar.html">article</a> on why he considers calendars on weblogs useless.  Funny I read this right after implementing mine.
<P>Well, the reason that I did mine is that I want my archives to be reachable in some fashion -- perhaps if only for google.  A search or keyword "related" section would be more usable, for sure.

<P>I have a calendar that now points to my archives.  I think that I'm at feature parity with what I was using from Radio, at least with respect to blog generation.  I didn't use any tables in my layout, so let me know if things don't look good in a browser other than IE for windows.
<P>I think that I'm done for tonight.  Next I'm going to work on an FTP upstreamer so that I can just hit a button (or work it on a timer/file system change notification) to upload the site instead of using <a href="http://www.smartftp.com">SmartFTP</a> to upload manually.
<P>In some ways this would be a lot easier with a server side solution backed up to SQL server.  I'm tempted to switch over, but I really do like the idea of client side+FTP.

<p>Okay, <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/2003/02/16.html#a204">Chris</a> has put me to shame.

<p>To try and redeem myself I have my archives working now.  I also have permalinks.

<p>I haven't uploaded posts in a couple of days as I renumbered all of my entries and I didn't want to screw everyone's Syndirella feed until I had permalinks and guids working.

<p>To see some of the workings behind the scenes, <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Templates/Main.xslt">here</a> is the xslt for my main page.

<P><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/02/08">Doc</a> had his laptop stolen.  This is something that I worry about all of the time. However, I think that I have things set so that I wouldn't skip a beat if my laptop was gone.  All of my files are shared between many programs using My Documents redirection.  This server that these files are stored on is maintained by the MS IT department and is backed up by them.  I use offline files  to cache those files locally when I'm not connected.  On top of that I checked the checkbox (it is that easy) to make my offline files encrypted.  That way I don't worry about someone getting ahold of trade secrets either.
<P>In fact, I recently just upgraded the hard drive on my laptop (to a sweet 60GB) and did a reinstall while I was at it.  No problems and no data lost.

<P>I now store the local time and GMT with each entry.  This seems to me to be the right way to do this.  The RSS feed is always GMT, but really, when you read a weblog, you want to know the local time when that was written.  It really puts it in context.
<P>This means that the entries on my weblog before the 5th are in PST and those after the 5th are in MST.  I wish there were standard ways to name timezones but that all seems a little tricky.
<P>With my current solution I can still keep all of my data in day based XML files.  I'm just clear that an entry gets slotted into a particular file based on the local time when it was written.
