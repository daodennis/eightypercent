<ul><li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0399149864&itm=1">Pattern Recognition</a> by William Gibson.  Short review: Not nearly as good as nueromancer -- wait for the paperback.
<li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0394555090&itm=1">Theodore Rex</a> by Edmund Morris.  This is the followup to <u>The Rise of Theordore Roosevelt</u>.  After reading both of them, I think that the early life of Roosevelt is more interesting and dynamic.  The detailed description of his years in the whitehouse was something of an anticlimax.
<li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0374528497&itm=1">The Metaphsycisal Club</a> by Louis Menand.  I just started this and it is heavy going.  However, I like it so far.  It isn't as dynamic (yet) as either of the Roosevent biographies.  I'll summerize after I finish it.
<li>Music: <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=696998641228">Scarlet's Walk</a> by Tori Amos.  This is some of her best stuff since Little Earthquakes.  
<li>Movie: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286499">Bend It Like Beckham</a>.  I saw this at the Idaho International Film Festival (Bet you didn't know that Idaho had a film festival) and I liked it a lot.  I thought it was clever with some hot women in it.  What's not to like?
<li>Movie: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0258068">The Quiet American</a>.  This 2002 remake of a 1958 film was very moving.  Starring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, it details a love triangle set in pre-US involvement Vietnam in the 50s.  Brendan Fraser is so hit or miss -- remember Monkeybone?
<li>Play: <a href="http://www.arbiteronline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/03/20/3e7920b2a19a6">Icarus</a> written by Edwin Sanchez and directed by Brian Weaver.  I enjoyed the play a lot -- I haven't been to a play in a while.  I thought the ending was a little bit of a let down.  It was very open ended.

<p>Now, for the tip of the day (or week, or whatever...)
<p>In debugging this latest problem, I had to download symbols for various OS components.  Internally, we have a pretty vast symbol server that can get you .PDBs for everything that you need.  Externally, you can get symbols for many components so that you can debug through them.  Nothing beats a good call stack!
<p>Both our internal and external systems use a <i>symbol server</i> to locate the right symbols.  We didn't have this until ~2 years ago, and I don't know how we lived without it.  Getting the right symbols used to be voodoo -- now it is super easy.  Here is a page talking about what you have to do: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging/symbols.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging/symbols.asp</a>.

<p>I'm going to be in Redmond again tomorrow and Wednesday so updates won't be happening then either.  Oh well.
<p>BTW, I've made some progress on my FTP uploader but not as much as I'd like.  I'll post something here when I have something to show.

<p>I've gotten some nibbles from at least 4 people on the upstreamer.  That isn't all 7 of you out there but I guess this will do :)
<p>I'll start on it this weekend or sometime early next week.  Hopefully it will go fast as I already have the FTP code.
<p><a href="http://gary.burd.info">Gary Burd</a> suggested a combo of ssh, rsync and a crontab entry. It looks like you can <a href="http://optics.ph.unimelb.edu.au/help/rsync/">install RSync on windows</a> if you try hard enough. However, I don't have that much control over all of the machines that I want to upload to, so this looks like a non-starter -- at least for me.  Getting a more secure connection would be nice, though.
<p>I also was thinking about taking advantage of the shadow copy stuff in XP but it looks like you need to sign an NDA to get at that SDK.  Oh well.

<P>I want to gauge interest in a new project.  How many of you out there (and I know there are something like 7 of you :) would actually use a utility that did the following:
<ul><li>Had a list of local directories and FTP servers/paths
<li>Monitored those dirs (timer or file change notifications) for changes.
<li>Upstream new files (based on file times) to the FTP server.  This wouldn't be a full sync but would rather be a copy.  It would never delete anything from the server.
<li>Has a tray icon to let you know what is going on.
</ul>

<P>BTW, this is a feature stolen almost verbatim from Radio.  I think that it would be useful to break it out into its own utility.

<P>The real reason I would want this is that frickin' VS.Net doesn't have a way to deply an ASP.Net application to an FTP server.  You can copy it or use FP extentions, but you can't FTP that guy up there.

<P>I would include source and an installer for this guy.
<P>If you are interested, email me at <a href="mailto:eightypercent at bedafamily.com">eightypercent at bedafamily.com</a> and I'll think about putting something together.

<p>In talking with <a href="http://ocw.abf.tulane.edu/blog/">Jorge</a> about how he does his site, he pointed me to his XSLT source.  I'll let him post links to those on his own site ifi he wants to.  However, he knows some advanced moves that I haven't discovered yet.  Here is one of them: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#dt-attribute-value-template">http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#dt-attribute-value-template</a>.  This is a huge keystroke saver.  It lets me go from this:
<pre>
&lt;A class="ArchiveLink"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:attribute name="href"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:value-of select="$SiteRoot"/&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of 
            select="user:FormatArchiveLink(LocalPubDate)"/&gt;#a&lt;xsl:value-of 
            select="BlogEntryNumber"/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:attribute&gt;
    &lt;!--....--&gt;
&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>
<p>To this:
<pre>
&lt;A class="ArchiveLink" href="{$SiteRoot}{user:FormatArchiveLink(LocalPubDate)}#a{BlogentryNumber}"&gt;
    &lt;!--....--&gt;
&lt;/A&gt;

<p><a href="http://ocw.abf.tulane.edu/blog/">Jorge Curioso</a> <a href="http://ocw.abf.tulane.edu/blog/?item=63182667125303">posted on his blog</a> some comments around dealing with dates in RSS and the .Net framework.  I figure I'd put some more detail up here on how I handle dates in JoeBlogger.
<ol>
<li>I store both GMT and local time when creating an entry.  I should probably keep a "last updated" time too but I haven't done that yet.  From these two you can either output absolute time (for RSS) or you can output local time so that everyone can know your state of mind when you made that post.  It makes a difference if you are posting at 5 am in the morning vs. 10 am.
<li>I used C# to do all of my date processing.  Here is the code for my properites for these things:
<pre>
        // The PubDate here is in universal time -- UTC
        [XmlIgnore]
        public DateTime PubDate;

        [XmlElement(ElementName="PubDate")]
        public string PubDateString 
        {
            get
            {
                return PubDate.ToString("r");
            }
            set
            {
                PubDate = DateTime.ParseExact(value,"r", null);
            }
        }

        [XmlIgnore]
        public DateTime LocalPubDate;

        [XmlElement(ElementName="LocalPubDate")]
        public string LocalPubDateString 
        {
            get
            {
                return LocalPubDate.ToString("ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH':'mm':'ss");
            }
            set
            {
                try
                {
                    LocalPubDate = DateTime.ParseExact(value,"ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH':'mm':'ss", null);
                }
                catch (FormatException)
                {
                    LocalPubDate = DateTime.MinValue;
                }
            }
        }
</pre>
<li>Finially, I do all of the massaging from these times into my display times in the stylesheet itself.  <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Stuff/SourceExample.xml">Here</a> is an example of a source XML document for my main page and <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Templates/Main.xslt">here</a> is my XSLT template for transforming that.  If you can assume the .Net implementation of XSLT, you can use some MS specific extensions like this:
<pre>
    &lt;msxsl:script implements-prefix='user' language='CSharp'&gt;
        &lt;![CDATA[
        public string FormatTime(string input)
        {
            DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact(input, "ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH':'mm':'ss", null);
            return dt.ToString("h':'mm':'ss tt");
        }
        public string FormatArchiveLink(string input)
        {
            DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact(input, "ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH':'mm':'ss", null);
            return String.Format(@"/Archive/{0:D4}/{1:D2}/{2:D2}.html", dt.Date.Year, dt.Date.Month, dt.Date.Day);
        }
        ]]&gt;
    &lt;/msxsl:script&gt;
</pre>
And then use that in the output like this:
<pre>
&lt;xsl:value-of select="user:FormatTime(LocalPubDate)"/&gt;
</pre>
</ol>

<p>It might be a good thing if we someone came up with a namespaced extension for RSS to speicfy local time along with GMT.  Having "First published" and "Last changed" times might be interesting also.  Perhaps I'll write something up at some point.
