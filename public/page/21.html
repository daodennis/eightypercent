<p>To make great panoramic pictures you need a panoramic head.  To make really great pictures you need a <i>spherical</i> panoramic head.  <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/">Max Lyons</a> and <a href="http://www.caldwellphotographic.com/MosaicTutorial.html>Brian Caldwell</a> both have examples of what can be done.  (Max says that he uses a homemade pano head with his Nikon 990, but I don't think that would work with my camera -- a Canon D60.)
<p>Unfortunately, spherical panoramic heads are, for some odd reason, very expensive.  Quality camera equipment, in general, is very very expensive, but these seem to be above and beyond.  For an example, check out <a href="http://www.kaidan.com/Detail.bok?no=44">this</a> product from Kaidan.  $740 is too much for me.
<p>I'm looking a constructing my own Pano head similar to what <a href="http://www.erik-krause.de/panohead/">Erik ruffle</a> has done.  I'm looking in to doing this with extruded aluminum "erector set" stock from <a href="http://www.erik-krause.de/panohead/">8020</a>.  I'm planning on mounting this on my <a href="http://www.acratech.net/prod01.htm">Acratech ball head</a>.  Like Erik, I plan on using the ball head upside down.  I've also purchased a Arca-swiss style quick release clamp from <a href="http://www.kirkphoto.com/platforms.html">Kirk Photo</a> to mount the camera.
<p>I'll post pictures if anything comes of this little project.

<p>I've been spending way too much time playing <a href="http://www.galciv.com">Galactic Civilizations</a> lately.  This game is like Masters of Orion, but better.  It is seriously hard.
<p>The support from the company and the forums is great also.  You can upload your game results and see how you are doing compared to everyone else.  I'm not doing so well...
<p>For $40 ($10 less than most other first-run games) this is a steal.  You can even download it directly and save yourself a trip to the store.

<p>While the work computer is installing the latest version of longhorn...
<ul><li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0399149864&itm=1">Pattern Recognition</a> by William Gibson.  Short review: Not nearly as good as nueromancer -- wait for the paperback.
<li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0394555090&itm=1">Theodore Rex</a> by Edmund Morris.  This is the followup to <u>The Rise of Theordore Roosevelt</u>.  After reading both of them, I think that the early life of Roosevelt is more interesting and dynamic.  The detailed description of his years in the whitehouse was something of an anticlimax.
<li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0374528497&itm=1">The Metaphsycisal Club</a> by Louis Menand.  I just started this and it is heavy going.  However, I like it so far.  It isn't as dynamic (yet) as either of the Roosevent biographies.  I'll summerize after I finish it.
<li>Music: <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=696998641228">Scarlet's Walk</a> by Tori Amos.  This is some of her best stuff since Little Earthquakes.  
<li>Movie: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286499">Bend It Like Beckham</a>.  I saw this at the Idaho International Film Festival (Bet you didn't know that Idaho had a film festival) and I liked it a lot.  I thought it was clever with some hot women in it.  What's not to like?
<li>Movie: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0258068">The Quiet American</a>.  This 2002 remake of a 1958 film was very moving.  Starring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, it details a love triangle set in pre-US involvement Vietnam in the 50s.  Brendan Fraser is so hit or miss -- remember Monkeybone?
<li>Play: <a href="http://www.arbiteronline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/03/20/3e7920b2a19a6">Icarus</a> written by Edwin Sanchez and directed by Brian Weaver.  I enjoyed the play a lot -- I haven't been to a play in a while.  I thought the ending was a little bit of a let down.  It was very open ended.

<p>Now, for the tip of the day (or week, or whatever...)
<p>In debugging this latest problem, I had to download symbols for various OS components.  Internally, we have a pretty vast symbol server that can get you .PDBs for everything that you need.  Externally, you can get symbols for many components so that you can debug through them.  Nothing beats a good call stack!
<p>Both our internal and external systems use a <i>symbol server</i> to locate the right symbols.  We didn't have this until ~2 years ago, and I don't know how we lived without it.  Getting the right symbols used to be voodoo -- now it is super easy.  Here is a page talking about what you have to do: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging/symbols.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging/symbols.asp</a>.  
<p>Also note that with VS.Net you can use this stuff too!  Here is a link on that: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q319037">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q319037</a>

<p>I haven't been posting lately because I've been super busy.  I've spent the weekend debugging a tough memory leak in some COM code.  I sure don't miss doing that with managed code!  
<p>I'm going to be in Redmond again tomorrow and Wednesday so updates won't be happening then either.  Oh well.
<p>BTW, I've made some progress on my FTP uploader but not as much as I'd like.  I'll post something here when I have something to show.

<p>I've gotten some nibbles from at least 4 people on the upstreamer.  That isn't all 7 of you out there but I guess this will do :)
<p>I'll start on it this weekend or sometime early next week.  Hopefully it will go fast as I already have the FTP code.
<p><a href="http://gary.burd.info">Gary Burd</a> suggested a combo of ssh, rsync and a crontab entry. It looks like you can <a href="http://optics.ph.unimelb.edu.au/help/rsync/">install RSync on windows</a> if you try hard enough. However, I don't have that much control over all of the machines that I want to upload to, so this looks like a non-starter -- at least for me.  Getting a more secure connection would be nice, though.
<p>I also was thinking about taking advantage of the shadow copy stuff in XP but it looks like you need to sign an NDA to get at that SDK.  Oh well.

<P>I want to gauge interest in a new project.  How many of you out there (and I know there are something like 7 of you :) would actually use a utility that did the following:
<ul><li>Had a list of local directories and FTP servers/paths
<li>Monitored those dirs (timer or file change notifications) for changes.
<li>Upstream new files (based on file times) to the FTP server.  This wouldn't be a full sync but would rather be a copy.  It would never delete anything from the server.
<li>Has a tray icon to let you know what is going on.
</ul>

<P>BTW, this is a feature stolen almost verbatim from Radio.  I think that it would be useful to break it out into its own utility.

<P>The real reason I would want this is that frickin' VS.Net doesn't have a way to deply an ASP.Net application to an FTP server.  You can copy it or use FP extentions, but you can't FTP that guy up there.

<P>I would include source and an installer for this guy.
<P>If you are interested, email me at <a href="mailto:eightypercent at bedafamily.com">eightypercent at bedafamily.com</a> and I'll think about putting something together.
