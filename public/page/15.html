        Canon <a href="http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/eosdigital/index.html">just announced</a> the
        new 300D.&#160; The camera itself is ugly, and it is an annoying all flash site, but
        it looks like this could bust things open.&#160; Current prices for DSLRs (the 10D)
        is around $1350.&#160; Dropping this below $1000 could really expand the market.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm just waiting to read some reviews and see how this is positioned relative to the
        10D.&#160; Reiner and Alice (Reiner is a personality in the NT world) just got a 10D
        and I was playing with it the other day.&#160; It just feels more solid than my D60.&#160;
        I hope that the 10D feels the same way, even though it is covered with chrome crap
        (like the Elan IIe film camera I started with).

        Check out <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,59900,00.html">this</a> article
        in wired.&#160; With a <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/CodeBlue">wife</a> that
        is a doctror, it always amuses me the capacity for people to think that the "system"
        is hiding the real cure from them.&#160; It seems to me that people always value the
        remedies that they have to go outside the "system" for.&#160; It is like that episode
        of Sienfeld where his dad would only take a gift if it were stolen. Is there a name
        for this phenomenon? 
    </p>
    <p>
        (I tried to find the&#160;specific episode for that Sienfeld reference but it turns
        out that there are better episode guides for <a href="http://www.whoosh.org/epguide/">Xena</a>&#160;and <a href="http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/GEFP/EpisodeIndex.htm">Good
        Eats</a> than I can for Sienfeld.&#160; The web works in mysterious ways.)

        When we are designing APIs, we think about this type of thing.&#160; We want to make
        it easier for the "bad programmer" to write code that isn't so bad.&#160; However,
        you can only do so much.

        After the first outage at Haloscan, I'll probably give up and write my own comment

        is still a client render/FTP too.&#160; The comment system will probably be similar

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/06/26.html">Earlier</a>, I was
        wondering if the new G5 Macs would have an OS that could take advantage of their 64
        bit nature, or if Apple was going to take a short cut and run the G5 in a compat mode.&#160;
        Apparently, that <em>is</em> going to be the case, at least according to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/31995.html">this
        Register article</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a lot of ways, this is just more hype from Apple.&#160; Many Intel processesors
        (I don't know the exact ones) actually have a 36 bit addressing bus.&#160; Those extra
        4 bits mean that the processor can actually address 16 times as much memory as a 32
        bit addressing bus.&#160; The difference is between 4GB and 64GB.&#160; However, most
        Windows machines don't take advantage of that extra capacity.&#160; The APIs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp?frame=true">are
        there</a> though, if you want to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, is the 64 bit nature of the G5 hype?&#160; As far as I can tell, right now the
        answer is yes.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Well, I'm sure that someone will port 64 bit Linux to it, and that will be cool.&#160;
        It might become the cheapest way to get a 64 bit linux machine, if AMD doesn't beat
        them to the punch)

        Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/23.html#a3879">linked to
        me</a>.&#160; Thanks dude!
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I'm not a PM.&#160; I'm a Dev Lead.&#160; I don't know if everyone knows
        the break down of different jobs at Microsoft, but, in the technical areas, there
        are three main jobs: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/programmanagement.aspx">Program
        Management</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaredevelopment.aspx">Development</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaretesting.aspx">Test</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The breakdown goes like this:&#160; PMs talk to customers, develop requirements and
        write specs, Devs implement the code to those specs and Test validates that the Devs
        did their job.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, things never work out that cleanly.&#160; For example, the Test team are
        some of the people first using the product so they may have more and better feedback
        than just if the program works.&#160; And in a techinical area, like what I'm working
        on (graphics and APIs), a lot of the design work can be done by devs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft is trying to develop higher level individual contributer developers to help
        lead the architecture of the product.&#160; I'm heading down that track right now.&#160; <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> is
        another example of this.&#160; Part of this is that just because you are good at writing
        code doesn't mean that you are good at managing people.&#160; Beyond that, it is <em>really</em> hard
        to find PMs that can operate at the technical level necessary for some groups -- such
        as designing windows APIs.&#160; As a result of this, higher level individual contributer
        devs and technical PMs do many of the same jobs.&#160; This is why I've spent that
        last year or so writing specs!
