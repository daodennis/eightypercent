    <p>
        The house stuff is winding down.&#160; We close on August 18th, and I think that we
        are mostly on cruise control until then.&#160; We needed the owners to put a new roof
        on the house, so there was quite a bit of back and forth on that.&#160; I think we
        have it worked out now!
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, this last weekend I went to my <a href="http://www.imsa93.org/">10 year
        high school</a> reunion.&#160; It was a blast!&#160; I should put some pictures up...
    </p>
    <p>
        (The reasons that I don't post any pictures is that I want to make JoeBlogger have
        a picture gallery mode and I haven't gotten around to coding it up yet.&#160; I should
        really get off my ass and do it.)

    <p>
        I'm back in Seattle for good!&#160; Yay! 
    </p>
    <p>
        On top of that, Rachel and I took this week off to move and buy a house.&#160; We've
        made an offer and they have accepted!&#160; The inspection is on Sunday and we are
        figuring out mortgage and insurance stuff.&#160; The house is in the <a href="http://montlake.net/montlake.asp">Montlake</a> neighborhood
        of Seattle.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The house is withing walking distance to the University hospital so, Rachel can walk
        to work most of the time.&#160; The rest of the time there are free shuttles that
        run from the U hospital to the other hospitals around Seattle.&#160; The house is
        also close enough to the freeway bus stop so I can stop sitting in my car and start
        sitting in a bus.&#160; Microsoft has a really good bus commuter program where anyone
        can get a free bus pass. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, in <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">great historic tradition</a>&#160;I may
        get busy with the house, the move and work and I may not be posting much.

    <p>
        Just wondering, but does anyone know if Mac OS X actually allows processes to run
        with a full 64 bit address space?&#160; Or is everything just running in a 32 bit
        compat mode?&#160; I couldn't see anything with a quick search on Apple's web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        WinNT ran on the 64 bit alpha quite a while ago, but it only ran in a 32 bit mode.&#160;
        Is Apple doing the same thing here?&#160; Is the whole 64 bit thing, wrt Apple, all
        flash and no fire?
    </p>
    <p>
        BTW, just because the&#160;new&#160;G5 machines&#160;can have 8GB of RAM doesn't mean
        that an <em>individual</em> process can access more than 4GB.&#160; Hell,&#160;some
        Intel procs&#160;can access &gt;4Gb, but they are still 32 bit processors.&#160; For
        example, the 32 bit version of W2k3 server can support 32GB of RAM.&#160; This extra
        RAM can be accessed via specialized APIs or you can have, for example, 10 processes
        each using 2GB.

    <p>
        I've released a new version of JoeBlogger based on feedback from <a href="http://www.neelbubba.com">Bubba</a> and <a href="http://devhawk.net/">Harry</a>.&#160;
        I've also fixed a few problems that I've found.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-0.9.1.msi">msi</a>, <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-src-0.9.1.zip">src</a>, <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/Readme-0.9.1.txt">readme</a> and <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/License.txt">license</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixed data loss issues when hitting "New Entry" button while current entry hasn't
            been uploaded.</li>
        <li>
            Fixed FTP issues with multi-line responses from FTP server.</li>
        <li>
            Added a "FilePutDelay" parameter to the site1.config file for dealing with FTP servers
            that get confused if you move too fast.&#160; This is in milliseconds.&#160; 1000
            seems to solve most problems.</li>
        <li>
            Moved some code around and had to put a custom binder in the upstreamer deserialization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There aren't any big new features yet.&#160; I just haven't had time.&#160; However,
        when the new system goes up at gotdotnet.com, I'll probably start a workspace over
        there.&#160; I haven't done it already because the current source control system that
        comes with the workspaces is really really bad.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, and since pretty pictures make everything go down smoother, here is a screenshot:

        I'm packing up to move back to Seattle, so don't expect a lot of posting over the

        Telecommuting was fun, but I'm really feeling out of the loop at work.&#160; I miss
        my friends and living in a big(ger) city.&#160; I'm looking forward to everything
        except the real commute across 520 every day.&#160; Oh well, I guess you have to take
        the good with the bad.

    <p>
        I freakin' hate ticketmaster.&#160; I just had to buy a baseball ticket -- just one
        as we have another person going to the game.&#160; The base ticket price is $16 but
        the total ended up being $22.81.&#160; That is a 43% service charge.&#160; That is
        more than I pay in income tax. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond this, I had to actually use the phone instead of doing it online because I
        wanted to get a seat as close to my other tickets.&#160; In addition to ripping me
        off they: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Asked for my email address to send me confirmation and then asked me if it is okay
            to sign me up to some random&#160;spam list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to sports illustrated. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to entertainment weekly. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to entice me to some other offer that I didn't catch because the poor guy in
            their phone center was mumbling. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Selling tickets can't be that hard a business to run.&#160; Are these guys just money
        hungry?
