      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net&#34;&gt;80%&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve rewritten my ancient blog on top of &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts&#34;&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt;.  The whole thing is hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jbeda/eightypercent&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you want to check out the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For headlines, I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Economica&#34;&gt;Economica&lt;/a&gt;.  I picked it because it is narrow and I tend to write long headlines.  The body text is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora&#34;&gt;Lora&lt;/a&gt;.  I like a nice Serif font for the body text and it has a bit of style while still being very readable.  Code is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Mono&#34;&gt;Roboto Mono&lt;/a&gt; and the Logo and Navigation is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Coda&#34;&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not in love with the color theme I have now (dark gray background with red and blue highlights) but it&amp;rsquo;ll do for now.  I played with some CSS gradients to show a preview on the main index page.  I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure &amp;ndash; it may be a little too cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done the work of importing my old blog posts and making Hugo create compatible URLs.  My original system used XML files for each day so I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jbeda/eightypercent/blob/master/old-blog/convert.go&#34;&gt;short Go program&lt;/a&gt; to convert from the XML to something Hugo can consume (markdown files with a JSON header).  I had to introduce a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jbeda/eightypercent/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/verbatim.html&#34;&gt;verbatim HTML shortcode&lt;/a&gt; to make Hugo pass through the HTML from the old blog directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other tricky thing was to generate a page per &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt; instead of a page per post for these old posts.  Rolling things up on a daily basis was the way things were done back when I started the blog in &lt;a href=&#34;http://new.eightypercent.net/post/old/00001.html&#34;&gt;January 2003&lt;/a&gt;.  Doing this daily roll up used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/taxonomies/overview/&#34;&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; feature of Hugo where the taxonomy was &amp;ldquo;archive&amp;rdquo; and the term was the day.  This was easy to generate from the Go conversion program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hosting this on GCE under Docker and NGINX.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to write up a post on how I&amp;rsquo;m doing that and automatically syncing it to the git repro on each submit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have it all set up, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I actually have anything to say&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HOWTO: Installing Highpoint Rocketraid 222x on Ubuntu Dapper (6.06 LTS)</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00274.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2007 22:19:30 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00274.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I haven&#39;t updated my blog in forever and I&#39;m probably going to abandon my homebrew
        static client generated site for something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://mephistoblog.com/&#34;&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; at
        some point but I haven&#39;t had time to make the transition. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In the meantime, I&#39;d like to save people some pain and document the steps I have go
        through to upgrade my Highpoint RocketRaid 2220 on Linux.&amp;#160; I installed the driver
        a while ago and don&#39;t remember the exact steps for that, so this is just what I do
        to upgrade.&amp;#160; I wrote a little shell script: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;#! /bin/sh -v

# Update this version every time you upgrade.
VER=2.6.15-29-686

# To update the highpoint driver:
# 1) Download latest highpoint driver from: 
#
# http://www.highpoint-tech.com/BIOS_Driver/rr222x/Linux/
#
# 2) Patch driver by changing wrong kernel #ifdefs in osm/linux/os_linux.c  
#   KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,15) -&amp;gt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,16)

# Disable sata_mv.ko by moving it to a new directory.  This driver
# conflicts with highpoint driver.  I don&#39;t know if this is the
# &#34;right&#34; way to do this, but it works.
sudo mkdir -p /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled
sudo mv /lib/modules/${VER}/kernel/drivers/scsi/sata_mv.ko /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled/

# Make sure kernel headers are installed
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-${VER}

# Make new hpt driver:
cd ~jbeda/sources/rr222x-linux-src-1.07/product/rr2220/linux/
make KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build
sudo make install KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build

# make a new ramfs
# mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-27-686 /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-686
sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-${VER}&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Good luck. I hope this helps people out there that are stuck with this thing. I&#39;m
        still looking for a good cheap solution to host lots of SATA drives on Linux.&amp;#160;
        Port multipliers are there and aren&#39;t as cheap as they should be.&amp;#160; The driver
        situation is pretty dire and there aren&#39;t that many non RAID (fake or not) &amp;gt;4 ports
        out there.&amp;#160; I haven&#39;t tried any SAS cards though -- perhaps the situation there
        is better.&amp;#160; I&#39;m also running an LSI MegaRAID SATA 300-8XLP with the megaraid
        driver.&amp;#160; It wasn&#39;t as cheap but at least it works with a true open driver.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#34;Avalon marks the end of the American Dream&#34;</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00273.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2006 09:56:19 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00273.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Miguel de Icaza says &lt;a href=&#34;http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Aug-02.html&#34;&gt;&#34;Avalon
        marks the end of the American Dream.&#34;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160; He also compares it to J2EE -- apparently
        implying that it is overly complex and overarchitected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Ouch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        While I wouldn&#39;t put it that way, I can&#39;t disagree.&amp;#160; I left Microsoft almost
        two years ago and Avalon still hasn&#39;t shipped.&amp;#160; A 5+ year ship cycle for a project
        can&#39;t be seen as anything but a sign that something is horribly wrong.&amp;#160; When
        I was on Avalon we kept talking about building an API for the next 10 years.&amp;#160;
        Apparently, when Avalon ships there will be 5 years left on that clock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I take partial responsibility for this.&amp;#160; When we were first starting Avalon,
        I was all about &#34;Go big or go home&#34; and &#34;We should build something only Microsoft
        can build.&#34;&amp;#160; In retrospect, the project and the company might have been better
        served by starting with a much smaller team, aiming lower to start and shipping 5
        times over those 5 years.&amp;#160; Version 1 might not have been that impressive, but
        relentless improvement would have built something better factored, simpler, and more
        in tune with what users actually need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I named this blog &#34;eightypercent&#34; in honor of the 80% rule.&amp;#160; It just so happens
        there there are lots of 80% rules to apply.&amp;#160; In this case, a simpler system that
        only solved 80% of the problem would have been good enough and would have shipped
        multiple times already.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        It looks like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22WPF%2FE%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search&#34;&gt;WPF/E&lt;/a&gt; project
        is an effort to&amp;#160;strip Avalon down to something much more approachable.&amp;#160;
        Cross platform, no full CLR, lower memory footprint -- sounds a lot like Flash/Flex.&amp;#160;
        I know some of the guys working on the project and I have high hopes that it will
        be something interesting.&amp;#160; The only question, when will&amp;#160;it ship?
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seattle&#39;s Homeless Alcoholics on NPR</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00272.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2006 10:07:05 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00272.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Coming in this morning, I heard a&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5567184&#34;&gt;segment
        on NPR&lt;/a&gt; covering a unique program that King Country is running to provide &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.desc.org/1811.html&#34;&gt;rooms
        for homeless alcoholics&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle.&amp;#160; The unique and controversial part of
        this program is that the residents can continue to drink. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        My wife, Rachel, has first hand experience with this problem from her work at the
        Harborview ER.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Some of these &#34;frequent fliers&#34; are indeed part of the community
        at the ER. In fact, one of the patients that Rachel had lots of interactions with
        (ever since she was a med student!) recently died and it really shook her up.&amp;#160;
        Anecdotally, Rachel has seen this program provide a positive impact. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, this novel program seems to me to be a unique way to approach a very
        difficult problem.&amp;#160; It reduces the cost to the taxpayers and provides a safe
        place for these individuals.&amp;#160; Obviously we would all like to see these problems
        solved, but, failing that, at least the county is trying to manage it. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom Weighted Vests</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00270.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Happy fourth!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I just wanted to post a note bragging about my sister, Jill.&amp;#160; The Chicago Tribune
        just &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0607040196jul04,1,4767917.story?ctrack=1&amp;amp;cset=true&#34;&gt;ran
        an article&lt;/a&gt; about her and her daughter Ellie.&amp;#160; Ellie has what they are calling
        &#34;Sensory Integration Disorder.&#34;&amp;#160; She is basically really hyper and needs to jump,
        spin, rock, swing, etc.&amp;#160; I think I probably had a touch of something similar
        when I was small.&amp;#160; One of the things that helps&amp;#160;Ellie has been a weighted
        vest.&amp;#160; Jill couldn&#39;t find any she and Ellie liked and so made one herself.&amp;#160;
        It turned out so well, she decided to start making them for others.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;ve helped her get a web site up and running to show off what she has done.&amp;#160;
        Check it out at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.customweightedvests.com&#34;&gt;www.customweightedvests.com&lt;/a&gt;.
        You can also check out some other custom sewing she does at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stitchessosweet.com&#34;&gt;www.stitchessosweet.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;

      <title>Link-Backup v 0.6</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Scott Ludwig and I have released a new version of&amp;#160;his python based backup script,
        Link-Backup.&amp;#160; This new version ignores broken symlinks and has an option to ensure
        that only one backup at a time is going on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Also with this release is a cgi script (viewlb.cgi) for exploring the backups.&amp;#160;
        This makes it easy to keep tabs on what is going on.&amp;#160; Scott wrote this script
        a while ago and I updated and improved it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Details &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottlu.com/2006/06/link-backup-v-06.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Annie loves flowers</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00268.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2006 20:59:37 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00268.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I haven&#39;t been posting anything lately because I&#39;ve been so busy with work and Annie.&amp;#160;
        It is funny how life gets in the way. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, she really loves flowers.&amp;#160; We try and go on a walk in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://depts.washington.edu/wpa/general.htm&#34;&gt;Washington
        Park Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;every day.&amp;#160; She loves to hold and pick little flowers.&amp;#160;
        Here is a quick photo I snapped of her today: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/AnnieFlower-small.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/AnnieFlower-thumb.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Speaking of the Arboretum, almost every time I go there, I see the official bird of
        Seattle, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seattleaudubon.org/birding.cfm?id=44&#34;&gt;Great Blue
        Heron&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Here is a snap of one of those guys from a couple of weeks ago.&amp;#160;
        He has just caught himself some dinner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/Heron-small.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/Heron-thumb.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Backing up data</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00267.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2006 14:12:37 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00267.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Between photos of Annie, other photography and music, I have quite a bit of data.&amp;#160;
        Probably over 300GB now and growing fast. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Backing up this much data is a challenge.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve set some requirements of for
        what I needed in a backup system: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Automatic&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; A backup system is useless if you don&#39;t actually
            use it.&amp;#160; I know that if I&#39;m required to do anything manually it probably won&#39;t
            get done. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Off site&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; There are too many things that can happen if you
            have an on site backup.&amp;#160; Your house can burn down, you can get robbed, etc. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Virus resistant&lt;/strong&gt;. If somehow a virus were to try and wipe everything
            out, I&#39;d like my&amp;#160;data to survive. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Versioned&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; In case I delete something and don&#39;t realize right
            away, I&#39;d like to keep versions of my data. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Big&lt;/strong&gt;. I have lots of data and I don&#39;t imagine that I&#39;m going to stop
            accumulating it.&amp;#160; I&#39;d like to plan for 800GB-1TB. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;On line&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; I want to be able to get to my backup without mounting/moving
            anything. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This is a pretty tall order.&amp;#160; Here are some things that I considered but decided
        not to do: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;RAID&lt;/strong&gt;. Mirroring is pretty secure in the face of hardware failure.&amp;#160;
            RAID 5 sounds great but stories I hear is that if one drive goes there is a serious
            chance another will go during the rebuilding.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Simply doing RAID&amp;#160;also
            fails to satisfy many of the requirements above. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;DVD&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; I started backing some stuff up on DVDs.&amp;#160; I got read
            errors a month later.&amp;#160; Too manual also. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;External Harddrives&lt;/strong&gt;. I thought about having a couple of really big
            external drives and rotating them.&amp;#160; This solves a lot of the problems above but
            it is pretty manual.&amp;#160; A friend of mine is going to do this and keep a copy at
            the office.&amp;#160; He said he planned to backup/move every couple of months.&amp;#160;
            That is just too long for me. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;NT Volume Shadow Copy&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a cool technology that can keep snapshots
            through time on a drive.&amp;#160; It looks like the Linux Volume Manager (LVM) can do
            some similar things.&amp;#160; This isn&#39;t really a backup solution as much as a versioning
            solution.&amp;#160; This plus RAID 0 is probably pretty good except it isn&#39;t off site. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I ended up going with a more brute force solution.&amp;#160; I bought and set up two Linux
        servers.&amp;#160; The first is a home server.&amp;#160; The second is in a datacenter in
        downtown Seattle. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The home Linux server is a dual core Pentium running Ubuntu 5.10 server.&amp;#160; I have
        a HW/SW raid card driving 5 250GB drives in RAID 5.&amp;#160; It servers a data share
        over Samba.&amp;#160; I backup that share to another directory every night.&amp;#160; That
        archive directory is shared out via Samba also, but as read-only.&amp;#160; This makes
        the situation fairly virus proof.&amp;#160; Since I have two copies of the data (one that
        is r/w and the other that is a backup) I might have to add more drives in the future.&amp;#160;
        I got a big honking case so I&#39;ll have room.&amp;#160; I&#39;m running slimserver on this amoung
        other things.&amp;#160; I also use it to do long running batch &lt;a href=&#34;http://enblend.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;enblend&lt;/a&gt; stitching
        jobs for panoramas. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The data center machine is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tyan.com/products/html/gt20b5151.html&#34;&gt;1U
        Tyan server&lt;/a&gt; with 4x320GB drives in Linux SW RAID 5.&amp;#160; It is also running Ubuntu
        5.10 server.&amp;#160; (Getting Ubuntu installed on a RAID5 drive array was a challenge.&amp;#160;
        I don&#39;t remember the exact steps I took or I would document them here.)&amp;#160; The
        cost of doing this can be high unless you have a friend that can get you hooked up.&amp;#160;
        Even if you can&#39;t, it might be worthwhile.&amp;#160; I&#39;m backing up to this every night
        over my cable modem.&amp;#160; The cable modem upload speed is okay since I upgraded to
        Comcast&#39;s higher level of service.&amp;#160; I now have ~768kbps up. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        There are a couple of choices for software for doing the backups.&amp;#160; The key is
        that it has to be bandwidth smart (only update diffs), handle versioning gracefully
        and be able to do partial copies based on a timer.&amp;#160; The last requirement is so
        that if I have a ton of data to upload it can go over a couple of nights.&amp;#160; The
        most obvious candidate for this is rsync.&amp;#160; rsync is an amazing tool for these
        types of things.&amp;#160; My MS friends think that robocopy is cool -- it can&#39;t hold
        a candle to rsync.&amp;#160; It also generally operates over ssh so it is also secure.
        It can also build version trees where unchanged files are hardlinked to previous versions.&amp;#160;
        The only thing it can&#39;t do is handle files that have moved but haven&#39;t changed, and
        stop itself after a certain number of minutes. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        To solve this problem, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottlu.com/&#34;&gt;Scott Ludwig&lt;/a&gt; (a coworker
        of mine who has a similar setup) developed a python script that does much of what
        rsync does but solves these two last problems.&amp;#160; It is called &#34;link backup&#34; and
        you can get it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottlu.com/Content/Link-Backup.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        Every night starting at 11:30pm, I run this backup script to backup my working directory
        to the backup directory on my home server.&amp;#160; This is usually pretty quick.&amp;#160;
        I then backup the latest snapshot of that backup set to the server in the datacenter.&amp;#160;
        This can take a little longer but at least I don&#39;t have to think about it. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Since I implemented this, Amazon&#39;s S3 has come on the scene.&amp;#160; While it might
        be interesting to back up using S3, I&#39;m not sure how the economics work out.&amp;#160;
        At my current level (300GB) and Amazon&#39;s pricing model ($0.15 per GB per month) I
        would be paying $45 per month.&amp;#160; If I grow to 600GB, I&#39;m up to $90 per month.&amp;#160;
        Bandwidth is extra, but I don&#39;t use much of that.&amp;#160; It should be easy to find
        colocation hosting for that amount of coin.&amp;#160; There is the one time cost of the
        hardware and the work of keeping it up to date also (I think my server came in around
        $1600 but I probably overbought).&amp;#160; The advantage is that you can run and do other
        things with your own server in a datacenter. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

      <title>New Google Talk Client</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00266.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2006 18:21:45 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00266.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        If you haven&#39;t heard yet, we shipped a new version of the Google Talk client to a
        small set of testers yesterday.&amp;#160; You can get a review over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.customizetalk.com/&#34;&gt;customizetalk.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        Hopefully we&#39;ll fix any outstanding issues and get this version out to everyone soon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I wasn&#39;t super involved in this version but did manage to sneak a couple of features
        in.&amp;#160; The first was Friend Online notifications (defaults to off to avoid annoying
        people). I also did the new hover cards for your Friends.&amp;#160; I wanted people to
        be able to see all of the cool pictures in&amp;#160;true 96x96 pixel alpha blended glory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        We hope you like it!&amp;#160; Let us know what features are important to you by filling
        out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/inquiry/talk_suggest&#34;&gt;suggestion form&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;
        I was going to stay away from all of the April 1st shenanigans, but couldn&#39;t pass
        up linking to the new Jingle transport spec that Peter Saint-Andre put together: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0183.html&#34;&gt;JEP-0183: Jingle Telepathy Transport&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Nice one!

      <title>The Swing Years and Beyond</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00264.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2006 19:16:40 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00264.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I must be getting old because every week I look forward to listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kuow.org/swing_years.asp&#34;&gt;The
        Swing Years and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; on KUOW, our local NPR station.&amp;#160; It runs from 7-12
        every Saturday and is always fun to listen to.&amp;#160; I&#39;m not an expert in the era
        or anything but Amanda Wilde (and Cynthia Doyon before her) always seem to hit the
        right note.&amp;#160; When I got my Honda Element it came with a free trial for XM radio.&amp;#160;
        They have a&amp;#160;1930s big band/swing station but it just isn&#39;t the same. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you don&#39;t live in Seattle you can listen to their &lt;a href=&#34;http://kuow.org/listen_live.asp&#34;&gt;streaming
        feed&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; No podcast/mp3 available though.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        My grandmother died recently and listening to this music always reminds me of her.&amp;#160;
        One of the songs they played a couple of weeks ago was &#34;Chattanooga Choo Choo.&#34;&amp;#160;
        I can&#39;t hear it without thinking of her favorite joke (copied from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dykerheights.com/jokes.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;): 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;
        Roy Rogers had just purchased a new set of boots. Going out one day to check on Trigger,
        Roy stepped in a pile of ... well suffice it to say that Dale told him to leave his
        boots outside on the porch until he could clean them up. Roy did so and went inside
        for dinner. In the meantime a cougar wandering around on the property spied the boots,
        grabbed them up in his mouth and headed for the wilderness. Roy, seeing his new boots
        heading for the hills, pulled on a pair of old boots, ran out and saddled up Trigger
        and headed for the hills to cut off the escape path of the cougar. Several hours later
        Roy returned, new boots in hand and the cougar stretched over the back of Trigger.
        Dale looking at the scene in front of her said &#34;Pardon me Roy is that the cat that
        chewed your new shoes?&#34; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;
        There are just so many ways my daughter won&#39;t get this joke. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;m sorry that I missed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2006-01.html#2006-01-27T19:31&#34;&gt;Peter
        Saint-Andre&#39;s presentation&lt;/a&gt; at Etel this last week.&amp;#160; I wanted to be down there
        but it is hard to get to conferences with the baby and all.&amp;#160; You can check out
        his slides off of that link.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Peter used a presentation style that I really like a lot.&amp;#160; I&#39;d love to see how
        he pulled it off.&amp;#160; Perhaps some video will surface?&amp;#160; If you want to see
        videos of talks done in a similar style check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5100194058815018708&amp;amp;q=lessig&#34;&gt;Larry
        Lessig&#39;s talk on Google Print&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/&#34;&gt;Dick
        Hardt&#39;s talk on Identity 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Very cool.&amp;#160; I&#39;m not sure I could pull
        it off though :)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Speaking of conferences, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; planning on being around for a day or two of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.von.com/&#34;&gt;Spring

      <title>Sleeping through the night</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00262.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2006 06:19:12 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00262.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Last night was the first time Annie slept through the night.&amp;#160; We put her to bed
        around 8pm and it is now 6:20am and she is still asleep. We&#39;ve been working over the
        past couple of nights to eliminate her&amp;#160;late night&amp;#160;feeding and help her to
        get back to sleep on her own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I mentioned to my wife this morning I feel like we discovered the lost city of gold.&amp;#160;
        Even if it doesn&#39;t go like this every night it is good to know that it can be done.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Here is a recent picture of our little babe:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&#34;Annie at 7 months&#34; hspace=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/Anne7Months.jpg&#34; align=&#34;baseline&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;

      <title>libjingle</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00261.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2005 21:48:23 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00261.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        The second thing that happened today is that we released &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html&#34;&gt;libjingle&lt;/a&gt; on
        sourceforge.&amp;#160;Full details are up on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-all-way.html&#34;&gt;Talk
        blog&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and at &lt;a href=&#34;http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-bells.html&#34;&gt;code.google.com&lt;/a&gt;.
        Sean Egan (of Gaim fame) packaged up the code that Talk uses to do p2p as a library
        for others to use.&amp;#160; Hopefully this will start a flood of interoperable voice
        (and other p2p applications).&amp;#160; So that anyone can use it the code is released
        under a berkeley style license. Sean put together some great docs on how to use the
        new library &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        One thing to keep in mind -- we haven&#39;t harmonized the specs and libjingle yet.&amp;#160;
        The goal is to have libjingle implement the spec as it matures.&amp;#160; Right now it
        just interoperates with Talk and is pretty far from the Jingle docs that the JSF released.&amp;#160;
        As the spec moves forward the code will converge.&amp;#160; Most of the differences right
        now are syntax.&amp;#160; For example the underlying technique for punching through NATs
        is unchanged and is an adaptation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-06.txt&#34;&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        We&#39;ve wanted to release this core part of the Talk application for a long time now
        and I&#39;m super excited to see it happen. The combination of these new standards and
        the libjingle library should be pretty potent.&amp;#160; And since&amp;#160;Jingle can be
        used for more than just voice, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see this stuff used in interesting and
        surprising ways that we never envisioned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Update12/17/2006: Clarified how divergent spec/code are and pointed to ICE.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
