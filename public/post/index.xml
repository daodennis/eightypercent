      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A lot of exciting things happened at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dockercon.com/&#34;&gt;Dockercon 2015&lt;/a&gt; last week.  For me the most exciting was the announcement of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://opencontainers.org/&#34;&gt;Open Container Project&lt;/a&gt; foundation.  Not only is it great to see the community come together under one banner but also as a chance to entertain new ideas in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some thoughts on how to improve what we consider a &amp;ldquo;container image.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m looking at both the container format itself and what goes on inside of it. This obviously builds on ideas in other systems and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to call those out.  These thoughts are still early so I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to find others of like mind and start a good discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;history-and-context:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba&#34;&gt;History and Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring most recently is the intersection between the container image format and package management.  While there has been plenty of attention on base OSs to host the container (&lt;a href=&#34;https://coreos.com/products/&#34;&gt;CoreOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://rancher.com/rancher-os/&#34;&gt;RancherOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.projectatomic.io/&#34;&gt;Project Atomic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/&#34;&gt;Snappy Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;) and efforts to coordinate a cluster of hosts (&lt;a href=&#34;http://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mesosphere.com/&#34;&gt;Mesosphere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/docker-swarm&#34;&gt;Docker Swarm&lt;/a&gt;) we haven&amp;rsquo;t paid as much attention as we could to what is going on &lt;strong&gt;inside&lt;/strong&gt; the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker Images&lt;/strong&gt; are great. Images are pretty efficient to push and pull and, with new focus on security, it is getting easier and easier to be sure that what you want in the image is actually what you are running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dockerfiles&lt;/strong&gt; are also great.  They are a purpose built makefile analog that are super easy to understand and logically build on the layered nature of Docker images.  Like most of the Docker project, they are much more approachable than other efforts in this area and solve real customer needs. When constructed appropriately, they allow for an efficient dev flow where many of the time consuming steps can be reused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;strong&gt;best innovations of Docker is actually a bit of an awesome hack&lt;/strong&gt;.  It leverages the package managers for existing Linux distributions.  Reusing the package manager means that users can ready any number of guides on how to get software installed and easily translate it into a Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: a typical Linux distribution is 2 things. First is a bunch of stuff to get the box booted.  Second is a package manager to install and manage software on that box.  Docker images typically only need the second one.  The first one is along for the ride even if the user never needs it.  There are package managers out there that are cleanly factored from the underlying OS (&lt;a href=&#34;http://brew.sh/&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nixos.org/nix/&#34;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;) but they aren&amp;rsquo;t typically used in Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;problems:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba&#34;&gt;Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all mostly works okay.  There is some cruft in the images that can easily be ignored and is &amp;ldquo;cheap&amp;rdquo; as the download and storage cost is amortized because of layer sharing for Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems with the current state of the world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No package introspection.&lt;/strong&gt;  When the next security issue comes along it is difficult to easily see which images are vulnerable.  Furthermore, it is hard to write automated policy to prevent those images from running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No easy sharing of packages.&lt;/strong&gt;  If 2 images install the same package, the bits for that package are downloaded twice.  It isn&amp;rsquo;t uncommon for users to construct complicated &amp;ldquo;inheritence&amp;rdquo; chains to help work around this issue&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:dockerfile-chains&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:dockerfile-chains&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No surgical package updating.&lt;/strong&gt;  Updating a package requires recreating an image and all re-running all downstream actions in the Dockerfile.  If users are good about tracking which sources go into which image&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:tracking-inputs&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:tracking-inputs&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it should be possible to just update the package but that is difficult and error prone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order dependent image builds.&lt;/strong&gt; Order matters in a Dockerfile &amp;mdash; even when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to.  Often times two actions have zero interaction with each other.  But Docker has no way of knowing that so must assume that every action depends on everything coming previously.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Package manager cruft.&lt;/strong&gt; Most well built Dockerfiles have something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RUN apt-get update \
  &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
  &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps to minimize the size of the layer on disk.  This is confusing boilerplate that is likely just cargo-culted by many users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideas-for-solutions:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba&#34;&gt;Ideas for Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t have a fully formed solution to all of these problems, I do have a bunch of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, imagine that we take the idea of a container image and break it down a little.  The first thing we define is a &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt;.  A &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt; is a named, versioned and verified set of files.  Google has a system internally called the &amp;ldquo;Midas Package Manager&amp;rdquo; (MPM) that this&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:decentralized-mpm&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:decentralized-mpm&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Dinah McNutt gave a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJlTllziPI&#34;&gt;great talk on MPM&lt;/a&gt; at a 2013 USENIX conference.  A further tweak would allow a &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt; to import other &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt;s into the file namespace of the host.  This allows for a &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt; to have multiple &amp;ldquo;parents&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; unlike the current Docker image format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we define a &lt;code&gt;Package&lt;/code&gt; as a type of &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt;.  It would have a standard directory structin and include metadata on other packages required along with simple instructions to &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; the package&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:package-install&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:package-install&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.Ideally, these packages would be built from verified sources and a verified tool chain.  This would enable true provenance for every bit.  This would be optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would redefine a &lt;code&gt;ContainerImage&lt;/code&gt; also as a type of &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt; that has metadata necessary to make it runnable.  The definition of this metadata is a big part of what the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/image/spec/v1.md&#34;&gt;Docker Image format&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/appc/spec/blob/master/SPEC.md&#34;&gt;ACI&lt;/a&gt; format are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;ContainerImage&lt;/code&gt; that is using this container native package system would define a set of read-only imports of all required packages &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt;s.  Image construction tools would verify that all dependencies are satisfied.  Furthermore, the install steps would be run to symlink all of the packages into the appropriate places&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:late-symlinking&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:late-symlinking&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User code could either be packed up as a &lt;code&gt;Package&lt;/code&gt; or just inserted directly into the &lt;code&gt;ContainerImage&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba&#34;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating a container friendly packaging system and expanding the idea of what an container image is, we can solve most of the issues outlined again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list of &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt;s imported into, say, &lt;code&gt;/packages&lt;/code&gt; would be the list of all packages versions that are included in that image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual &lt;code&gt;FileSet&lt;/code&gt;s could be cached by hosts and easily and safely shared between disparate images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A package could be updated in a straightforward way.  The toolset would have to make sure that all dependencies are satisfied and that the install steps are run as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image build tools would list the packages necessary and order wouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter.  Because there are multiple &amp;ldquo;parents&amp;rdquo; to an image, order cannot matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The package install cruft (archived version of the package) would be handled on the host side similar to images themselves.  The only thing the container would see would be the actual files &amp;ndash; and they would be symlinked in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some missing and underdefined parts to this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How are packages created?&lt;/em&gt;  I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that we could do that by running a container with build time packages that produces output file into a specific directory.  Files in that directory are then used to create a package.  As part of this the inputs into the build container could be included in the package metadata and signed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does a package distribution look like?&lt;/em&gt;  I imagine we&amp;rsquo;d have curated sets of packages that are known to work well together.  For instance, xyz.com could create &lt;code&gt;xyz.com/apache&lt;/code&gt; that depends on &lt;code&gt;xyz.com/openssl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do users override packages?&lt;/em&gt;  Perhaps &lt;code&gt;abc.com/openssl&lt;/code&gt; could specify that it can be used in place of &lt;code&gt;xyz.com/openssl&lt;/code&gt;.  Any guarantees by &lt;code&gt;xyz.com&lt;/code&gt; would be void but it would be a way to do custom versions and carry patches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opportunity: Kernel and capability requirements.&lt;/em&gt;  Packages could specify their requirements in a way that would be visible to the host.  This would provide a more direct requirement chain between the host and the code running in the container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution obviously borrows from both Homebrew and Nix.  What I think is new here is the idea of expanding the definition of an container image with FileSets and making this be fundamentally decentralized.  We also need to ensure that the easy to approach spirit of Dockerfile isn&amp;rsquo;t lost.  If we do this right we can make images much easier to efficiently create, verify, update and manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ping back to me on twitter (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/jbeda&#34;&gt;@jbeda&lt;/a&gt;) or we can talk over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9814131&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower&#34;&gt;Kelsey Hightower&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing an earlier version of this post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:dockerfile-chains&#34;&gt;The standard golang image is a great example of this.  &lt;code&gt;golang:1.4.2&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;code&gt;buildpack-deps:jessie-scm&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;code&gt;buildpack-deps:jessie-curl&lt;/code&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;code&gt;debian:jessie&lt;/code&gt;.  Most of this is done to enable efficient sharing of installed packages.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:dockerfile-chains&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:tracking-inputs&#34;&gt;Best practices should be to track every single input into your docker file.  That means that if you are pushing sources you should know which git commit, for example, those sources come from.  My guess is that this is rarely done.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:tracking-inputs&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:decentralized-mpm&#34;&gt;Actually, we need our system to be decentralized.  MPM, like may package management systems (including &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs&#34;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;) has a single central repository/database of all packages.  Whatever is used here must be distributed &amp;mdash; probably in a namespace rooted with DNS.  Something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/notary&#34;&gt;Docker Notary&lt;/a&gt; would play a role in signing and verifying packages.  Something like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lethalman.blogspot.com/2014/08/nix-pill-9-automatic-runtime.html&#34;&gt;Nix archive format (NAR)&lt;/a&gt; will help make this more stable and predictable.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:decentralized-mpm&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:package-install&#34;&gt;Package install should consist of simply symlinking files into some common directories (&lt;code&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/lib&lt;/code&gt;).  This would all be done via a declarative manifest. There are probably going to be cases where an &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo; is a little bit more complex and a script is necessary.  I&amp;rsquo;d love to see how far we could get before that becomes absolutely necessary.  It is also assumed that the package directories themselves are only ever mounted read only.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:package-install&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:late-symlinking&#34;&gt;There is a choice on when the package install happens.  It could happen early as the container is created.  Or it could happen late as part of the container start process.  I&amp;rsquo;d prefer late binding as it makes surgical package updating simpler.  The directories that store the symlinks could be tmpfs directories to keep this all very speedy.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:e2f7abed0f5b0c5bd1e697591b3ae6ba:late-symlinking&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A New Beginning...</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/relaunch.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2015 17:08:02 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/relaunch.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eightypercent.net&#34;&gt;80%&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve rewritten my ancient blog on top of &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts&#34;&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt;.  The whole thing is hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jbeda/eightypercent&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you want to check out the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For headlines, I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Economica&#34;&gt;Economica&lt;/a&gt;.  I picked it because it is narrow and I tend to write long headlines.  The body text is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora&#34;&gt;Lora&lt;/a&gt;.  I like a nice Serif font for the body text and it has a bit of style while still being very readable.  Code is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Mono&#34;&gt;Roboto Mono&lt;/a&gt; and the Logo and Navigation is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Coda&#34;&gt;Coda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not in love with the color theme I have now (dark gray background with red and blue highlights) but it&amp;rsquo;ll do for now.  I played with some CSS gradients to show a preview on the main index page.  I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure &amp;ndash; it may be a little too cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done the work of importing my old blog posts and making Hugo create compatible URLs.  My original system used XML files for each day so I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jbeda/eightypercent/blob/master/old-blog/convert.go&#34;&gt;short Go program&lt;/a&gt; to convert from the XML to something Hugo can consume (markdown files with a JSON header).  I had to introduce a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jbeda/eightypercent/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/verbatim.html&#34;&gt;verbatim HTML shortcode&lt;/a&gt; to make Hugo pass through the HTML from the old blog directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other tricky thing was to generate a page per &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt; instead of a page per post for these old posts.  Rolling things up on a daily basis was the way things were done back when I started the blog in &lt;a href=&#34;http://new.eightypercent.net/post/old/00001.html&#34;&gt;January 2003&lt;/a&gt;.  Doing this daily roll up used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/taxonomies/overview/&#34;&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; feature of Hugo where the taxonomy was &amp;ldquo;archive&amp;rdquo; and the term was the day.  This was easy to generate from the Go conversion program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hosting this on GCE under Docker and NGINX.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to write up a post on how I&amp;rsquo;m doing that and automatically syncing it to the git repro on each submit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have it all set up, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I actually have anything to say&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HOWTO: Installing Highpoint Rocketraid 222x on Ubuntu Dapper (6.06 LTS)</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00274.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2007 22:19:30 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00274.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I haven&#39;t updated my blog in forever and I&#39;m probably going to abandon my homebrew
        static client generated site for something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://mephistoblog.com/&#34;&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt; at
        some point but I haven&#39;t had time to make the transition. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In the meantime, I&#39;d like to save people some pain and document the steps I have go
        through to upgrade my Highpoint RocketRaid 2220 on Linux.&amp;#160; I installed the driver
        a while ago and don&#39;t remember the exact steps for that, so this is just what I do
        to upgrade.&amp;#160; I wrote a little shell script: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;#! /bin/sh -v

# Update this version every time you upgrade.
VER=2.6.15-29-686

# To update the highpoint driver:
# 1) Download latest highpoint driver from: 
#
# http://www.highpoint-tech.com/BIOS_Driver/rr222x/Linux/
#
# 2) Patch driver by changing wrong kernel #ifdefs in osm/linux/os_linux.c  
#   KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,15) -&amp;gt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,16)

# Disable sata_mv.ko by moving it to a new directory.  This driver
# conflicts with highpoint driver.  I don&#39;t know if this is the
# &#34;right&#34; way to do this, but it works.
sudo mkdir -p /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled
sudo mv /lib/modules/${VER}/kernel/drivers/scsi/sata_mv.ko /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled/

# Make sure kernel headers are installed
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-${VER}

# Make new hpt driver:
cd ~jbeda/sources/rr222x-linux-src-1.07/product/rr2220/linux/
make KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build
sudo make install KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build

# make a new ramfs
# mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-27-686 /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-686
sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-${VER}&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Good luck. I hope this helps people out there that are stuck with this thing. I&#39;m
        still looking for a good cheap solution to host lots of SATA drives on Linux.&amp;#160;
        Port multipliers are there and aren&#39;t as cheap as they should be.&amp;#160; The driver
        situation is pretty dire and there aren&#39;t that many non RAID (fake or not) &amp;gt;4 ports
        out there.&amp;#160; I haven&#39;t tried any SAS cards though -- perhaps the situation there
        is better.&amp;#160; I&#39;m also running an LSI MegaRAID SATA 300-8XLP with the megaraid
        driver.&amp;#160; It wasn&#39;t as cheap but at least it works with a true open driver.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#34;Avalon marks the end of the American Dream&#34;</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00273.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Miguel de Icaza says &lt;a href=&#34;http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Aug-02.html&#34;&gt;&#34;Avalon
        marks the end of the American Dream.&#34;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160; He also compares it to J2EE -- apparently
        implying that it is overly complex and overarchitected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Ouch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        While I wouldn&#39;t put it that way, I can&#39;t disagree.&amp;#160; I left Microsoft almost
        two years ago and Avalon still hasn&#39;t shipped.&amp;#160; A 5+ year ship cycle for a project
        can&#39;t be seen as anything but a sign that something is horribly wrong.&amp;#160; When
        I was on Avalon we kept talking about building an API for the next 10 years.&amp;#160;
        Apparently, when Avalon ships there will be 5 years left on that clock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I take partial responsibility for this.&amp;#160; When we were first starting Avalon,
        I was all about &#34;Go big or go home&#34; and &#34;We should build something only Microsoft
        can build.&#34;&amp;#160; In retrospect, the project and the company might have been better
        served by starting with a much smaller team, aiming lower to start and shipping 5
        times over those 5 years.&amp;#160; Version 1 might not have been that impressive, but
        relentless improvement would have built something better factored, simpler, and more
        in tune with what users actually need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I named this blog &#34;eightypercent&#34; in honor of the 80% rule.&amp;#160; It just so happens
        there there are lots of 80% rules to apply.&amp;#160; In this case, a simpler system that
        only solved 80% of the problem would have been good enough and would have shipped
        multiple times already.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        It looks like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=%22WPF%2FE%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search&#34;&gt;WPF/E&lt;/a&gt; project
        is an effort to&amp;#160;strip Avalon down to something much more approachable.&amp;#160;
        Cross platform, no full CLR, lower memory footprint -- sounds a lot like Flash/Flex.&amp;#160;
        I know some of the guys working on the project and I have high hopes that it will
        be something interesting.&amp;#160; The only question, when will&amp;#160;it ship?
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seattle&#39;s Homeless Alcoholics on NPR</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00272.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2006 10:07:05 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00272.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Coming in this morning, I heard a&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5567184&#34;&gt;segment
        on NPR&lt;/a&gt; covering a unique program that King Country is running to provide &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.desc.org/1811.html&#34;&gt;rooms
        for homeless alcoholics&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle.&amp;#160; The unique and controversial part of
        this program is that the residents can continue to drink. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        My wife, Rachel, has first hand experience with this problem from her work at the
        Harborview ER.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Some of these &#34;frequent fliers&#34; are indeed part of the community
        at the ER. In fact, one of the patients that Rachel had lots of interactions with
        (ever since she was a med student!) recently died and it really shook her up.&amp;#160;
        Anecdotally, Rachel has seen this program provide a positive impact. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, this novel program seems to me to be a unique way to approach a very
        difficult problem.&amp;#160; It reduces the cost to the taxpayers and provides a safe
        place for these individuals.&amp;#160; Obviously we would all like to see these problems
        solved, but, failing that, at least the county is trying to manage it. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Happy fourth!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I just wanted to post a note bragging about my sister, Jill.&amp;#160; The Chicago Tribune
        just &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0607040196jul04,1,4767917.story?ctrack=1&amp;amp;cset=true&#34;&gt;ran
        an article&lt;/a&gt; about her and her daughter Ellie.&amp;#160; Ellie has what they are calling
        &#34;Sensory Integration Disorder.&#34;&amp;#160; She is basically really hyper and needs to jump,
        spin, rock, swing, etc.&amp;#160; I think I probably had a touch of something similar
        when I was small.&amp;#160; One of the things that helps&amp;#160;Ellie has been a weighted
        vest.&amp;#160; Jill couldn&#39;t find any she and Ellie liked and so made one herself.&amp;#160;
        It turned out so well, she decided to start making them for others.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;ve helped her get a web site up and running to show off what she has done.&amp;#160;
        Check it out at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.customweightedvests.com&#34;&gt;www.customweightedvests.com&lt;/a&gt;.
        You can also check out some other custom sewing she does at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stitchessosweet.com&#34;&gt;www.stitchessosweet.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Scott Ludwig and I have released a new version of&amp;#160;his python based backup script,
        Link-Backup.&amp;#160; This new version ignores broken symlinks and has an option to ensure
        that only one backup at a time is going on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Also with this release is a cgi script (viewlb.cgi) for exploring the backups.&amp;#160;
        This makes it easy to keep tabs on what is going on.&amp;#160; Scott wrote this script
        a while ago and I updated and improved it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Details &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottlu.com/2006/06/link-backup-v-06.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Annie loves flowers</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00268.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2006 20:59:37 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00268.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I haven&#39;t been posting anything lately because I&#39;ve been so busy with work and Annie.&amp;#160;
        It is funny how life gets in the way. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, she really loves flowers.&amp;#160; We try and go on a walk in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://depts.washington.edu/wpa/general.htm&#34;&gt;Washington
        Park Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;every day.&amp;#160; She loves to hold and pick little flowers.&amp;#160;
        Here is a quick photo I snapped of her today: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/AnnieFlower-small.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/AnnieFlower-thumb.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Speaking of the Arboretum, almost every time I go there, I see the official bird of
        Seattle, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seattleaudubon.org/birding.cfm?id=44&#34;&gt;Great Blue
        Heron&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Here is a snap of one of those guys from a couple of weeks ago.&amp;#160;
        He has just caught himself some dinner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

      <title>Backing up data</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00267.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2006 14:12:37 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00267.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Between photos of Annie, other photography and music, I have quite a bit of data.&amp;#160;
        Probably over 300GB now and growing fast. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Backing up this much data is a challenge.&amp;#160; I&#39;ve set some requirements of for
        what I needed in a backup system: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Automatic&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; A backup system is useless if you don&#39;t actually
            use it.&amp;#160; I know that if I&#39;m required to do anything manually it probably won&#39;t
            get done. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Off site&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; There are too many things that can happen if you
            have an on site backup.&amp;#160; Your house can burn down, you can get robbed, etc. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Virus resistant&lt;/strong&gt;. If somehow a virus were to try and wipe everything
            out, I&#39;d like my&amp;#160;data to survive. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Versioned&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; In case I delete something and don&#39;t realize right
            away, I&#39;d like to keep versions of my data. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Big&lt;/strong&gt;. I have lots of data and I don&#39;t imagine that I&#39;m going to stop
            accumulating it.&amp;#160; I&#39;d like to plan for 800GB-1TB. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;On line&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; I want to be able to get to my backup without mounting/moving
            anything. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This is a pretty tall order.&amp;#160; Here are some things that I considered but decided
        not to do: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;RAID&lt;/strong&gt;. Mirroring is pretty secure in the face of hardware failure.&amp;#160;
            RAID 5 sounds great but stories I hear is that if one drive goes there is a serious
            chance another will go during the rebuilding.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Simply doing RAID&amp;#160;also
            fails to satisfy many of the requirements above. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;DVD&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#160; I started backing some stuff up on DVDs.&amp;#160; I got read
            errors a month later.&amp;#160; Too manual also. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;External Harddrives&lt;/strong&gt;. I thought about having a couple of really big
            external drives and rotating them.&amp;#160; This solves a lot of the problems above but
            it is pretty manual.&amp;#160; A friend of mine is going to do this and keep a copy at
            the office.&amp;#160; He said he planned to backup/move every couple of months.&amp;#160;
            That is just too long for me. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;NT Volume Shadow Copy&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a cool technology that can keep snapshots
            through time on a drive.&amp;#160; It looks like the Linux Volume Manager (LVM) can do
            some similar things.&amp;#160; This isn&#39;t really a backup solution as much as a versioning
            solution.&amp;#160; This plus RAID 0 is probably pretty good except it isn&#39;t off site. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I ended up going with a more brute force solution.&amp;#160; I bought and set up two Linux
        servers.&amp;#160; The first is a home server.&amp;#160; The second is in a datacenter in
        downtown Seattle. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The home Linux server is a dual core Pentium running Ubuntu 5.10 server.&amp;#160; I have
        a HW/SW raid card driving 5 250GB drives in RAID 5.&amp;#160; It servers a data share
        over Samba.&amp;#160; I backup that share to another directory every night.&amp;#160; That
        archive directory is shared out via Samba also, but as read-only.&amp;#160; This makes
        the situation fairly virus proof.&amp;#160; Since I have two copies of the data (one that
        is r/w and the other that is a backup) I might have to add more drives in the future.&amp;#160;
        I got a big honking case so I&#39;ll have room.&amp;#160; I&#39;m running slimserver on this amoung
        other things.&amp;#160; I also use it to do long running batch &lt;a href=&#34;http://enblend.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;enblend&lt;/a&gt; stitching
        jobs for panoramas. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The data center machine is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tyan.com/products/html/gt20b5151.html&#34;&gt;1U
        Tyan server&lt;/a&gt; with 4x320GB drives in Linux SW RAID 5.&amp;#160; It is also running Ubuntu
        5.10 server.&amp;#160; (Getting Ubuntu installed on a RAID5 drive array was a challenge.&amp;#160;
        I don&#39;t remember the exact steps I took or I would document them here.)&amp;#160; The
        cost of doing this can be high unless you have a friend that can get you hooked up.&amp;#160;
        Even if you can&#39;t, it might be worthwhile.&amp;#160; I&#39;m backing up to this every night
        over my cable modem.&amp;#160; The cable modem upload speed is okay since I upgraded to
        Comcast&#39;s higher level of service.&amp;#160; I now have ~768kbps up. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        There are a couple of choices for software for doing the backups.&amp;#160; The key is
        that it has to be bandwidth smart (only update diffs), handle versioning gracefully
        and be able to do partial copies based on a timer.&amp;#160; The last requirement is so
        that if I have a ton of data to upload it can go over a couple of nights.&amp;#160; The
        most obvious candidate for this is rsync.&amp;#160; rsync is an amazing tool for these
        types of things.&amp;#160; My MS friends think that robocopy is cool -- it can&#39;t hold
        a candle to rsync.&amp;#160; It also generally operates over ssh so it is also secure.
        It can also build version trees where unchanged files are hardlinked to previous versions.&amp;#160;
        The only thing it can&#39;t do is handle files that have moved but haven&#39;t changed, and
        stop itself after a certain number of minutes. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        To solve this problem, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottlu.com/&#34;&gt;Scott Ludwig&lt;/a&gt; (a coworker
        of mine who has a similar setup) developed a python script that does much of what
        rsync does but solves these two last problems.&amp;#160; It is called &#34;link backup&#34; and
        you can get it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottlu.com/Content/Link-Backup.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        Every night starting at 11:30pm, I run this backup script to backup my working directory
        to the backup directory on my home server.&amp;#160; This is usually pretty quick.&amp;#160;
        I then backup the latest snapshot of that backup set to the server in the datacenter.&amp;#160;
        This can take a little longer but at least I don&#39;t have to think about it. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Since I implemented this, Amazon&#39;s S3 has come on the scene.&amp;#160; While it might
        be interesting to back up using S3, I&#39;m not sure how the economics work out.&amp;#160;
        At my current level (300GB) and Amazon&#39;s pricing model ($0.15 per GB per month) I
        would be paying $45 per month.&amp;#160; If I grow to 600GB, I&#39;m up to $90 per month.&amp;#160;
        Bandwidth is extra, but I don&#39;t use much of that.&amp;#160; It should be easy to find
        colocation hosting for that amount of coin.&amp;#160; There is the one time cost of the
        hardware and the work of keeping it up to date also (I think my server came in around
        $1600 but I probably overbought).&amp;#160; The advantage is that you can run and do other
        things with your own server in a datacenter. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

      <title>New Google Talk Client</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00266.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2006 18:21:45 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00266.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        If you haven&#39;t heard yet, we shipped a new version of the Google Talk client to a
        small set of testers yesterday.&amp;#160; You can get a review over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.customizetalk.com/&#34;&gt;customizetalk.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        Hopefully we&#39;ll fix any outstanding issues and get this version out to everyone soon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I wasn&#39;t super involved in this version but did manage to sneak a couple of features
        in.&amp;#160; The first was Friend Online notifications (defaults to off to avoid annoying
        people). I also did the new hover cards for your Friends.&amp;#160; I wanted people to
        be able to see all of the cool pictures in&amp;#160;true 96x96 pixel alpha blended glory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        We hope you like it!&amp;#160; Let us know what features are important to you by filling
        out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/inquiry/talk_suggest&#34;&gt;suggestion form&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;
        I was going to stay away from all of the April 1st shenanigans, but couldn&#39;t pass
        up linking to the new Jingle transport spec that Peter Saint-Andre put together: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0183.html&#34;&gt;JEP-0183: Jingle Telepathy Transport&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Nice one!

      <title>The Swing Years and Beyond</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00264.html</link>

      <guid>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00264.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I must be getting old because every week I look forward to listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kuow.org/swing_years.asp&#34;&gt;The
        Swing Years and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; on KUOW, our local NPR station.&amp;#160; It runs from 7-12
        every Saturday and is always fun to listen to.&amp;#160; I&#39;m not an expert in the era
        or anything but Amanda Wilde (and Cynthia Doyon before her) always seem to hit the
        right note.&amp;#160; When I got my Honda Element it came with a free trial for XM radio.&amp;#160;
        They have a&amp;#160;1930s big band/swing station but it just isn&#39;t the same. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you don&#39;t live in Seattle you can listen to their &lt;a href=&#34;http://kuow.org/listen_live.asp&#34;&gt;streaming
        feed&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; No podcast/mp3 available though.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        My grandmother died recently and listening to this music always reminds me of her.&amp;#160;
        One of the songs they played a couple of weeks ago was &#34;Chattanooga Choo Choo.&#34;&amp;#160;
        I can&#39;t hear it without thinking of her favorite joke (copied from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dykerheights.com/jokes.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;): 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;
        Roy Rogers had just purchased a new set of boots. Going out one day to check on Trigger,
        Roy stepped in a pile of ... well suffice it to say that Dale told him to leave his
        boots outside on the porch until he could clean them up. Roy did so and went inside
        for dinner. In the meantime a cougar wandering around on the property spied the boots,
        grabbed them up in his mouth and headed for the wilderness. Roy, seeing his new boots
        heading for the hills, pulled on a pair of old boots, ran out and saddled up Trigger
        and headed for the hills to cut off the escape path of the cougar. Several hours later
        Roy returned, new boots in hand and the cougar stretched over the back of Trigger.
        Dale looking at the scene in front of her said &#34;Pardon me Roy is that the cat that
        chewed your new shoes?&#34; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;
        There are just so many ways my daughter won&#39;t get this joke. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I&#39;m sorry that I missed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2006-01.html#2006-01-27T19:31&#34;&gt;Peter
        Saint-Andre&#39;s presentation&lt;/a&gt; at Etel this last week.&amp;#160; I wanted to be down there
        but it is hard to get to conferences with the baby and all.&amp;#160; You can check out
        his slides off of that link.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Peter used a presentation style that I really like a lot.&amp;#160; I&#39;d love to see how
        he pulled it off.&amp;#160; Perhaps some video will surface?&amp;#160; If you want to see
        videos of talks done in a similar style check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5100194058815018708&amp;amp;q=lessig&#34;&gt;Larry
        Lessig&#39;s talk on Google Print&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/&#34;&gt;Dick
        Hardt&#39;s talk on Identity 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Very cool.&amp;#160; I&#39;m not sure I could pull
        it off though :)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Speaking of conferences, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; planning on being around for a day or two of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.von.com/&#34;&gt;Spring
        VON&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Sleeping through the night</title>
      <link>http://new.eightypercent.net:81/post/old/00262.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        Last night was the first time Annie slept through the night.&amp;#160; We put her to bed
        around 8pm and it is now 6:20am and she is still asleep. We&#39;ve been working over the
        past couple of nights to eliminate her&amp;#160;late night&amp;#160;feeding and help her to
        get back to sleep on her own.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I mentioned to my wife this morning I feel like we discovered the lost city of gold.&amp;#160;
        Even if it doesn&#39;t go like this every night it is good to know that it can be done.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Here is a recent picture of our little babe:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;img alt=&#34;Annie at 7 months&#34; hspace=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/Anne7Months.jpg&#34; align=&#34;baseline&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;
