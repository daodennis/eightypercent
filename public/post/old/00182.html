        I'm done with my part of helping make WinHEC a success.&#160; My talk went off pretty
        well and we got some great questions and comments.&#160; I also worked the booth and
        showed&#160;industry and press people what Longhorn can do.&#160; The big news for
        the WinHEC release is that we now have a start to our 3D APIs.&#160; We had a couple
        of examples that show mixing 3D and 2D in a seamless way.&#160; I tried to go out
        of my way to make sure that everyone knew that Avalon was much more than just graphics.&#160;
        We are a full UI platoform that includes controls, styling, databinding, etc.

        The main demo I was showing was a simulated "blood sugar tracker."&#160; It essentially
        has a 3D bar graph in the background that slowly rotates.&#160; Layered on that are
        semi-transparent buttons.&#160; There is also a details panel that can come up that
        is semi-transparent and has another 3D scene hosted inside of it.&#160; We have a
        vector graphic doctor icon in the corner that you can zoom in on to see that it is
        rasterized at the device resolution.&#160; The really impressive thing here is that
        our demo team (a dev and a designer) took 2-3 days to turn this from an email idea
        into reality.&#160; Robert and <a href="http://longhornblogs.com/ndunlap/">Nathan</a> did
        a great job of showing the power of Avalon.&#160; Here is a screen shot:
