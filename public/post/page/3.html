        Monday I start work again after taking three weeks off to spend with the <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/06/25.html">Anne</a>.&#160;
        If I've been slow to answer mail, that is why.&#160; It is amazing how much activity

        I <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/09/02.html">left Microsoft for
        Google</a> one year ago today.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've got to be honest; it was a little scary when I left.&#160; I started at Microsoft
        right out of college after two internships.&#160; Up until a year ago, the lion's
        share of my professional experience had been at Microsoft.&#160; Microsoft can be
        a very comfortable place (much less so since they've been cutting benefits).&#160;
        From the outside, I've also been able to look at Microsoft with different eyes.&#160;
        What I used to rationalize away now appears <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001835.php">absurd
        on the face</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is one year&#160;later and I'm sure that I made the right decision.&#160; I've
        been much happier over the last year at Google.&#160; I'm sure some of it was the
        excitement of just doing something different, but a lot of it really came from the
        energy of those I work with and actually <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249">shipping
        product</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh yeah, and my non-compete and non-solicit contracts with Microsoft have now expired.&#160;
        If you are looking for new challenges feel free to send me a resume.

    <p>
        There have been a lot of questions around Google's approach to federation -- both&#160;in
        the comments on this blog and in other forums (the jdev list, slashdot, etc).&#160;
        I apologize for the delay in responding to these questions head on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We've updated our FAQ to clarify some changes.&#160; To save everyone having to look
        it up in the Google cache, here is the before: 
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="-1">We look forward to federating with any service provider
    who shares our belief in enabling user choice and open communications. We do believe,
    however, that it is important to balance openness with ensuring that we maintain a
    safe and reliable service that protects user privacy and blocks spam and other abuses.
    We are using the federation opportunity with EarthLink and Sipphone to develop a set
    of guidelines by which all members of the federated network can work together to ensure
    that we protect our users while maximizing the reach of the network. [...]</font></blockquote> 
    <p>
        Here is the new text (changes in red): 
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><strong style="COLOR: red">We plan to support open server-to-server
    federation.</strong> We do believe, however, that it is important to <strong style="COLOR: red">have
    the safeguards in place</strong> to ensure that we maintain a safe and reliable service
    that protects user privacy and blocks spam and other abuses. We are using the federation
    opportunity with EarthLink, Sipphone <strong style="COLOR: red">and other partners</strong> to
    develop a set of <strong style="COLOR: red">best practices</strong> by which all members
    of the federated network can work together to ensure that we protect our users while
    maximizing the reach of the network. [...]</font></blockquote> 
    <p>
        On top of that, one of my fellow Google Talk developers, Gary Burd,&#160;has introduced
        himself to the Jabber developer mailing list.&#160; You can read his first post <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2005-August/021792.html">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I, personally, look forward to a long and fruitful partnership between Google and
        the Jabber community.

        <h2><a href="/post/old/00252.html">DVD Review: Yosemite in Winter</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Sat, Aug 27, 2005</span>
        <div class="post">
          <p>

    <p>
        Annie and I watched a DVD this morning while I was feeding her.&#160; Actually, she
        wasn't paying that much attention, but I was.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DVD was <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/">Steve Kossack</a>'s new DVD documenting
        one of his workshops to Yosemite during the winter.&#160; The DVD is what Steve hopes
        will be first of a series: "<span class="style1">Steve Kossack: Photographing the
        Great American Landscape."&#160; This one is titled <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/DVD/index.htm">"Yosemite
        in the&#160;Winter."</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that I have the baby, I don't have the time to go on workshops like this, so this
        is the&#160;next best thing.&#160; If you are interested in landscape photography
        at all, this DVD will be of interest to you.&#160; If you haven't been on a photo
        workshop, the video will give you an idea of what one of those workshops is like --
        without the waking up at 4:30 am to hit a sunrise shoot.&#160; If you are planning
        on doing Yosemite on your own, Steve's DVD will provide an invaluable guide to how
        to approach the area and some great places to shoot.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for Steve himself, I've been on two of his workshops so far (Death Valley and <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/past_ws/past04.htm#landmarks2">Landmarks
        of the Southwest</a>) and both were great.&#160; Steve really knows his stuff -- both
        on the photography side and on the natural and human history of the area.&#160; I've
        never been to Yosemite, but I'd love to go with Steve sometime in the future.

        the once in a while conference that Microsoft holds where they talk about all things
        Microsoft.&#160; It is more forward looking than a lot of the other MS conferences.]
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going to the PDC to keep up with what is going on with Windows.&#160; Drop me
        a line if you'd like to chat about Google Talk or anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not sure which sessions I'm going to attend yet, but I can tell you that my interests
        have shifted somewhat since I've shipped software on the outside.&#160; I'm much more
        interested in stuff that can help make Google Talk better now than more forward looking
        stuff that may not ship for another year yet.&#160; I'm also a lot less interested
        in huge frameworks that tie my product to Windows.&#160; While Google Talk is right
        now just a Windows only application, we've worked hard to keep the Win32 only stuff
        isolated so that it will be easier for us to port/write on other platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, is anyone working on an Avalon/.Net Jabber/XMPP client?&#160; I've
        been looking at the SSL/TLS support in the WinFX SDK and it might be possible to do
        it without any reliance on external libraries.

        We've been working to bring together our new IM service.&#160; Most of the development
        was centered up here in the Kirkland office.&#160; Watch this space (and others) for

    </p>
    <p>
        In case you've missed the fireworks, here is the summary of what we've done:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Instant messaging server based on the XMPP/Jabber protocol.&#160; This is an IETF
            approved protocol.&#160; Check out <a href="http://www.xmpp.org">www.xmpp.org</a> for
            more info.</li>
        <li>
            Out of the box support for many third party clients.&#160; Choose iChat, Gaim, Trillian
            or a host of others.&#160; We support them from day one.</li>
        <li>
            Our own client available for download from <a href="http://talk.google.com">talk.google.com</a>.&#160;
            We've concentrated on a simple to use and clean interface.&#160; We've tried to strip
            IM down to its essence.</li>
        <li>
            Support for voice calls between clients that just work.&#160; We've worked hard to
            support all sorts of network topologies.&#160; We are also using first class industry
            leading audio codecs.</li>
        <li>
            A commitment to openness moving forward.&#160; Choose your platform (Window, Mac,
            Linux, etc), choose your client (ours or others) and choose your service provider
            (we are commited to federation).&#160; We want to make IM as open as the web or email.</li>

        <div class="post">
          <p>

    <p>
        I'm an engineer at heart and I like to understand how things work.&#160; Our new baby, <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/06/25.html#a244">Anne</a>,
        is no exception.&#160; Let's take a programmers approach to understanding this mysterious
        black box. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Inputs (the 5 senses): 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Sight </strong>Anne certainly likes to look around.&#160; My understanding
            is that babies generally see only high contrast at a pretty short distance (1 foot?)&#160;
            She certainly likes looking at faces close up. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sound </strong>Whitenoise is supposed to be soothing.&#160; She also likes
            U2 and (heaven help me) Cher.&#160; Loud.&#160; I think she likes my singing too.&#160;
            I'm not sure why. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Taste </strong>She eats a lot.&#160; I'm not sure how much variation in taste
            she actually gets.&#160; There are theories that the mother's diet can affect the
            milk, but I haven't personally verified that. <em>Ewwww.</em> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Touch </strong>Babies need to be held and touched.&#160; They also need to
            be warm.&#160; One input is swaddling&#160;-- wrapping her tightly so that she can't
            move her arms or legs. Rocking and dancing with her count here too. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Smell </strong>Smell is supposed to be one of the most powerful senses.&#160;
            I've yet to see her react to any smells specifically, but I'm sure she is paying attention. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Outputs: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Biological Outputs</strong> Doctors are funny creatures.&#160;&#160; They
            are really concerned about all forms of matter escaping from our bodies: liquid, solid
            or gas.&#160; Parents also pay close attention to this.&#160; The amount, type and
            origin seem to be important clues to understanding the baby. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cries </strong>She has many and varied cries.&#160; Some of them are short
            yelps to draw attention while others are reports of murder nearby.&#160; Then there
            is the scary quivering lower lip.&#160; This is supposedly normal and a byproduct
            of her immature nervous system.&#160; It just kills me to see her do it though. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Posture </strong>The way she holds her body is an important clue.&#160; If
            she is curled up like a bug or stretched out and rigid means something. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Eyes and Face </strong>Her eyes and face are very expressive.&#160; Almost
            too expressive.&#160; She goes through a facial expression every 5 seconds or so.

            <strong>Sleep</strong> You'd think that it would be easy to tell if she is asleep
            or not.&#160; It really isn't though.&#160; She can be sleeping with her eyes closed
            or just pretending to sleep so that the minute you put her down she perks right up
            again.

        There you have it&#160;-- 5 inputs and 5 outputs.&#160; Sounds like a pretty simple
        system to me.&#160; The problem is that she is indeed a very complex state machine.&#160;
        She is so complex that there is no way to map the effect of the inputs (feeding her,
        for example) to the outputs (her current crying state).&#160; One would think that
        it would be easy to empirically derive causal relationships between certain inputs
        and certain outputs.&#160; Nope. She has more states than a Rubik's cube (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube">43,252,003,274,489,856,000</a>).
        The baby is indeed a very complex creature that does not yield her secrets to such
        a naïve logical approach.

        The amazing part is that biology takes over.&#160; My own brain is more complex than
        it can understand.&#160; It has adapted to the baby and somehow we're able make it
        work.&#160; Except when we can't&#160;-- like last night when all of us were up every
        90 minutes.<br />
