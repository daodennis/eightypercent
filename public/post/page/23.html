<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>

<p>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.</p>

<p>Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it&rsquo;s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
Markdown&rsquo;s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
filters &ndash; including <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html">Setext</a>, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/">atx</a>, <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>, <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>,
<a href="http://www.triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html">Grutatext</a>, and <a href="http://ettext.taint.org/doc/">EtText</a> &ndash; the single biggest source of
inspiration for Markdown&rsquo;s syntax is the format of plain text email.</p>

<p>To this end, Markdown&rsquo;s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation
characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so
as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually
look like *emphasis*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even
blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you&rsquo;ve ever
used email.</p>

<h3 id="html">Inline HTML</h3>

<p>Markdown&rsquo;s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a
format for <em>writing</em> for the web.</p>

<p>Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its
syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of
HTML tags. The idea is <em>not</em> to create a syntax that makes it easier
to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to
insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and
edit prose. HTML is a <em>publishing</em> format; Markdown is a <em>writing</em>
format. Thus, Markdown&rsquo;s formatting syntax only addresses issues that
can be conveyed in plain text.</p>

<p>For any markup that is not covered by Markdown&rsquo;s syntax, you simply
use HTML itself. There&rsquo;s no need to preface it or delimit it to
indicate that you&rsquo;re switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use
the tags.</p>

<p>The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements &ndash; e.g. <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, etc. &ndash; must be separated from surrounding
content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should
not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not
to add extra (unwanted) <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags around HTML block-level tags.</p>

<p>For example, to add an HTML table to a Markdown article:</p>

<pre><code>This is a regular paragraph.

&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Foo&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This is another regular paragraph.
</code></pre>

<p>Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level
HTML tags. E.g., you can&rsquo;t use Markdown-style <code>*emphasis*</code> inside an
HTML block.</p>

<p>Span-level HTML tags &ndash; e.g. <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> &ndash; can be
used anywhere in a Markdown paragraph, list item, or header. If you
want, you can even use HTML tags instead of Markdown formatting; e.g. if
you&rsquo;d prefer to use HTML <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags instead of Markdown&rsquo;s
link or image syntax, go right ahead.</p>

<p>Unlike block-level HTML tags, Markdown syntax <em>is</em> processed within
span-level tags.</p>

<h3 id="autoescape">Automatic Escaping for Special Characters</h3>

<p>In HTML, there are two characters that demand special treatment: <code>&lt;</code>
and <code>&amp;</code>. Left angle brackets are used to start tags; ampersands are
used to denote HTML entities. If you want to use them as literal
characters, you must escape them as entities, e.g. <code>&amp;lt;</code>, and
<code>&amp;amp;</code>.</p>

<p>Ampersands in particular are bedeviling for web writers. If you want to
write about &lsquo;AT&amp;T&rsquo;, you need to write &lsquo;<code>AT&amp;amp;T</code>&rsquo;. You even need to
escape ampersands within URLs. Thus, if you want to link to:</p>

<pre><code>http://images.google.com/images?num=30&amp;q=larry+bird
</code></pre>

<p>you need to encode the URL as:</p>

<pre><code>http://images.google.com/images?num=30&amp;amp;q=larry+bird
</code></pre>

<p>in your anchor tag <code>href</code> attribute. Needless to say, this is easy to
forget, and is probably the single most common source of HTML validation
errors in otherwise well-marked-up web sites.</p>

<p>Markdown allows you to use these characters naturally, taking care of
all the necessary escaping for you. If you use an ampersand as part of
an HTML entity, it remains unchanged; otherwise it will be translated
into <code>&amp;amp;</code>.</p>

<p>So, if you want to include a copyright symbol in your article, you can write:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;copy;
</code></pre>

<p>and Markdown will leave it alone. But if you write:</p>

<pre><code>AT&amp;T
</code></pre>

<p>Markdown will translate it to:</p>

<pre><code>AT&amp;amp;T
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, because Markdown supports <a href="#html">inline HTML</a>, if you use
angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markdown will treat them as
such. But if you write:</p>

<pre><code>4 &lt; 5
</code></pre>

<p>Markdown will translate it to:</p>

<pre><code>4 &amp;lt; 5
</code></pre>

<p>However, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle brackets and
ampersands are <em>always</em> encoded automatically. This makes it easy to use
Markdown to write about HTML code. (As opposed to raw HTML, which is a
terrible format for writing about HTML syntax, because every single <code>&lt;</code>
and <code>&amp;</code> in your example code needs to be escaped.)</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="block">Block Elements</h2>

<h3 id="p">Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h3>

<p>A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
blank line &ndash; a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered
blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.</p>

<p>The implication of the &ldquo;one or more consecutive lines of text&rdquo; rule is
that Markdown supports &ldquo;hard-wrapped&rdquo; text paragraphs. This differs
significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable
Type&rsquo;s &ldquo;Convert Line Breaks&rdquo; option) which translate every line break
character in a paragraph into a <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>When you <em>do</em> want to insert a <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> break tag using Markdown, you
end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.</p>

<p>Yes, this takes a tad more effort to create a <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>, but a simplistic
&ldquo;every line break is a <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>&rdquo; rule wouldn&rsquo;t work for Markdown.
Markdown&rsquo;s email-style <a href="#blockquote">blockquoting</a> and multi-paragraph <a href="#list">list items</a>
work best &ndash; and look better &ndash; when you format them with hard breaks.</p>

<h3 id="header">Headers</h3>

<p>Markdown supports two styles of headers, <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html">Setext</a> and <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/">atx</a>.</p>

<p>Setext-style headers are &ldquo;underlined&rdquo; using equal signs (for first-level
headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). For example:</p>

<pre><code>This is an H1
=============

This is an H2
-------------
</code></pre>

<p>Any number of underlining <code>=</code>&rsquo;s or <code>-</code>&rsquo;s will work.</p>

<p>Atx-style headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line,
corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:</p>

<pre><code># This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, you may &ldquo;close&rdquo; atx-style headers. This is purely
cosmetic &ndash; you can use this if you think it looks better. The
closing hashes don&rsquo;t even need to match the number of hashes
used to open the header. (The number of opening hashes
determines the header level.) :</p>

<pre><code># This is an H1 #

## This is an H2 ##

### This is an H3 ######
</code></pre>

<h3 id="blockquote">Blockquotes</h3>

<p>Markdown uses email-style <code>&gt;</code> characters for blockquoting. If you&rsquo;re
familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you
know how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard
wrap the text and put a <code>&gt;</code> before every line:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
&gt; consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
&gt; Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
&gt; 
&gt; Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
&gt; id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
</code></pre>

<p>Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the <code>&gt;</code> before the first
line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

&gt; Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse
id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
</code></pre>

<p>Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by
adding additional levels of <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; This is the first level of quoting.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This is nested blockquote.
&gt;
&gt; Back to the first level.
</code></pre>

<p>Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists,
and code blocks:</p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="this-is-a-header:e8fb9c67eba912c72729806db31eaa1b">This is a header.</h2>

<ol>
<li>This is the first list item.</li>
<li>This is the second list item.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some example code:</p>

<pre><code>return shell_exec(&quot;echo $input | $markdown_script&quot;);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For
example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase
Quote Level from the Text menu.</p>

<h3 id="list">Lists</h3>

<p>Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.</p>

<p>Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens &ndash; interchangably
&ndash; as list markers:</p>

<pre><code>*   Red
*   Green
*   Blue
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>+   Red
+   Green
+   Blue
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>-   Red
-   Green
-   Blue
</code></pre>

<p>Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:</p>

<pre><code>1.  Bird
2.  McHale
3.  Parish
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the
list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTML
Markdown produces from the above list is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McHale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:</p>

<pre><code>1.  Bird
1.  McHale
1.  Parish
</code></pre>

<p>or even:</p>

<pre><code>3. Bird
1. McHale
8. Parish
</code></pre>

<p>you&rsquo;d get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to,
you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that
the numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML.
But if you want to be lazy, you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>If you do use lazy list numbering, however, you should still start the
list with the number 1. At some point in the future, Markdown may support
starting ordered lists at an arbitrary number.</p>

<p>List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by
up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more spaces
or a tab.</p>

<p>To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:</p>

<pre><code>*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
</code></pre>

<p>But if you want to be lazy, you don&rsquo;t have to:</p>

<pre><code>*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
</code></pre>

<p>If list items are separated by blank lines, Markdown will wrap the
items in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags in the HTML output. For example, this input:</p>

<pre><code>*   Bird
*   Magic
</code></pre>

<p>will turn into:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this:</p>

<pre><code>*   Bird

*   Magic
</code></pre>

<p>will turn into:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent
paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces
or one tab:</p>

<pre><code>1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
    mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
    sit amet velit.

2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
</code></pre>

<p>It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent
paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be
lazy:</p>

<pre><code>*   This is a list item with two paragraphs.

    This is the second paragraph in the list item. You're
only required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor
sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

*   Another item in the same list.
</code></pre>

<p>To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote&rsquo;s <code>&gt;</code>
delimiters need to be indented:</p>

<pre><code>*   A list item with a blockquote:

    &gt; This is a blockquote
    &gt; inside a list item.
</code></pre>

<p>To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs
to be indented <em>twice</em> &ndash; 8 spaces or two tabs:</p>

<pre><code>*   A list item with a code block:

        &lt;code goes here&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that it&rsquo;s possible to trigger an ordered list by
accident, by writing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>1986. What a great season.
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, a <em>number-period-space</em> sequence at the beginning of a
line. To avoid this, you can backslash-escape the period:</p>

<pre><code>1986\. What a great season.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="precode">Code Blocks</h3>

<p>Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or
markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines
of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block
in both <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<p>To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the
block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:</p>

<pre><code>This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.
</code></pre>

<p>Markdown will generate:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a normal paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is a code block.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>One level of indentation &ndash; 4 spaces or 1 tab &ndash; is removed from each
line of the code block. For example, this:</p>

<pre><code>Here is an example of AppleScript:

    tell application &quot;Foo&quot;
        beep
    end tell
</code></pre>

<p>will turn into:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of AppleScript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tell application &quot;Foo&quot;
    beep
end tell
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented
(or the end of the article).</p>

<p>Within a code block, ampersands (<code>&amp;</code>) and angle brackets (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>)
are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very
easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown &ndash; just paste
it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the
ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div class=&quot;footer&quot;&gt;
        &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will turn into:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;footer&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,
asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means
it&rsquo;s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown&rsquo;s own syntax.</p>

<h3 id="hr">Horizontal Rules</h3>

<p>You can produce a horizontal rule tag (<code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code>) by placing three or
more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. If you
wish, you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the
following lines will produce a horizontal rule:</p>

<pre><code>* * *

***

*****

- - -

---------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h2 id="span">Span Elements</h2>

<h3 id="link">Links</h3>

<p>Markdown supports two style of links: <em>inline</em> and <em>reference</em>.</p>

<p>In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].</p>

<p>To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately
after the link text&rsquo;s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,
put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an <em>optional</em>
title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:</p>

<pre><code>This is [an example](http://example.com/ &quot;Title&quot;) inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
</code></pre>

<p>Will produce:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com/&quot; title=&quot;Title&quot;&gt;
an example&lt;/a&gt; inline link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.net/&quot;&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; has no
title attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you&rsquo;re referring to a local resource on the same server, you can
use relative paths:</p>

<pre><code>See my [About](/about/) page for details.   
</code></pre>

<p>Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside
which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:</p>

<pre><code>This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
</code></pre>

<p>You can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets:</p>

<pre><code>This is [an example] [id] reference-style link.
</code></pre>

<p>Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this,
on a line by itself:</p>

<pre><code>[id]: http://example.com/  &quot;Optional Title Here&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>That is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Square brackets containing the link identifier (optionally
indented from the left margin using up to three spaces);</li>
<li>followed by a colon;</li>
<li>followed by one or more spaces (or tabs);</li>
<li>followed by the URL for the link;</li>
<li>optionally followed by a title attribute for the link, enclosed
in double or single quotes, or enclosed in parentheses.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following three link definitions are equivalent:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a known bug in Markdown.pl 1.0.1 which prevents
single quotes from being used to delimit link titles.</p>

<p>The link URL may, optionally, be surrounded by angle brackets:</p>

<pre><code>[id]: &lt;http://example.com/&gt;  &quot;Optional Title Here&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>You can put the title attribute on the next line and use extra spaces
or tabs for padding, which tends to look better with longer URLs:</p>

<pre><code>[id]: http://example.com/longish/path/to/resource/here
    &quot;Optional Title Here&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Link definitions are only used for creating links during Markdown
processing, and are stripped from your document in the HTML output.</p>

<p>Link definition names may consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and
punctuation &ndash; but they are <em>not</em> case sensitive. E.g. these two
links:</p>

<p>[link text][a]
  [link text][A]</p>

<p>are equivalent.</p>

<p>The <em>implicit link name</em> shortcut allows you to omit the name of the
link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name.
Just use an empty set of square brackets &ndash; e.g., to link the word
&ldquo;Google&rdquo; to the google.com web site, you could simply write:</p>

<p><a href="http://google.com/">Google</a></p>

<p>And then define the link:</p>

<p>Because link names may contain spaces, this shortcut even works for
multiple words in the link text:</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> for more information.</p>

<p>And then define the link:</p>

<p>Link definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markdown document. I
tend to put them immediately after each paragraph in which they&rsquo;re
used, but if you want, you can put them all at the end of your
document, sort of like footnotes.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of reference links in action:</p>

<pre><code>I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].

  [1]: http://google.com/        &quot;Google&quot;
  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  &quot;Yahoo Search&quot;
  [3]: http://search.msn.com/    &quot;MSN Search&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Using the implicit link name shortcut, you could instead write:</p>

<pre><code>I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from
[Yahoo][] or [MSN][].

  [google]: http://google.com/        &quot;Google&quot;
  [yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/  &quot;Yahoo Search&quot;
  [msn]:    http://search.msn.com/    &quot;MSN Search&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Both of the above examples will produce the following HTML output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;I get 10 times more traffic from &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com/&quot;
title=&quot;Google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; than from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://search.yahoo.com/&quot; title=&quot;Yahoo Search&quot;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.msn.com/&quot; title=&quot;MSN Search&quot;&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For comparison, here is the same paragraph written using
Markdown&rsquo;s inline link style:</p>

<pre><code>I get 10 times more traffic from [Google](http://google.com/ &quot;Google&quot;)
than from [Yahoo](http://search.yahoo.com/ &quot;Yahoo Search&quot;) or
[MSN](http://search.msn.com/ &quot;MSN Search&quot;).
</code></pre>

<p>The point of reference-style links is not that they&rsquo;re easier to
write. The point is that with reference-style links, your document
source is vastly more readable. Compare the above examples: using
reference-style links, the paragraph itself is only 81 characters
long; with inline-style links, it&rsquo;s 176 characters; and as raw HTML,
it&rsquo;s 234 characters. In the raw HTML, there&rsquo;s more markup than there
is text.</p>

<p>With Markdown&rsquo;s reference-style links, a source document much more
closely resembles the final output, as rendered in a browser. By
allowing you to move the markup-related metadata out of the paragraph,
you can add links without interrupting the narrative flow of your
prose.</p>

<h3 id="em">Emphasis</h3>

<p>Markdown treats asterisks (<code>*</code>) and underscores (<code>_</code>) as indicators of
emphasis. Text wrapped with one <code>*</code> or <code>_</code> will be wrapped with an
HTML <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag; double <code>*</code>&rsquo;s or <code>_</code>&rsquo;s will be wrapped with an HTML
<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag. E.g., this input:</p>

<pre><code>*single asterisks*

_single underscores_

**double asterisks**

__double underscores__
</code></pre>

<p>will produce:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;em&gt;single asterisks&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;single underscores&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;double asterisks&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;double underscores&lt;/strong&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can use whichever style you prefer; the lone restriction is that
the same character must be used to open and close an emphasis span.</p>

<p>Emphasis can be used in the middle of a word:</p>

<pre><code>un*frigging*believable
</code></pre>

<p>But if you surround an <code>*</code> or <code>_</code> with spaces, it&rsquo;ll be treated as a
literal asterisk or underscore.</p>

<p>To produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it
would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash
escape it:</p>

<pre><code>\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*
</code></pre>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (<code>`</code>).
Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a
normal paragraph. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Use the `printf()` function.
</code></pre>

<p>will produce:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;printf()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To include a literal backtick character within a code span, you can use
multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters:</p>

<pre><code>``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``
</code></pre>

<p>which will produce this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;There is a literal backtick (`) here.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The backtick delimiters surrounding a code span may include spaces &ndash;
one after the opening, one before the closing. This allows you to place
literal backtick characters at the beginning or end of a code span:</p>

<p>A single backtick in a code span: <code>`</code></p>

<p>A backtick-delimited string in a code span: <code>`foo`</code></p>

<p>will produce:</p>

<p><p>A single backtick in a code span: <code>`</code></p></p>

<p><p>A backtick-delimited string in a code span: <code><code>foo</code></code></p></p>

<p>With a code span, ampersands and angle brackets are encoded as HTML
entities automatically, which makes it easy to include example HTML
tags. Markdown will turn this:</p>

<pre><code>Please don't use any `&lt;blink&gt;` tags.
</code></pre>

<p>into:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Please don't use any &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can write this:</p>

<pre><code>`&amp;#8212;` is the decimal-encoded equivalent of `&amp;mdash;`.
</code></pre>

<p>to produce:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8212;&lt;/code&gt; is the decimal-encoded
equivalent of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mdash;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="img">Images</h3>

<p>Admittedly, it&rsquo;s fairly difficult to devise a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; syntax for
placing images into a plain text document format.</p>

<p>Markdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax
for links, allowing for two styles: <em>inline</em> and <em>reference</em>.</p>

<p>Inline image syntax looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg &quot;Optional title&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>That is:</p>

<ul>
<li>An exclamation mark: <code>!</code>;</li>
<li>followed by a set of square brackets, containing the <code>alt</code>
attribute text for the image;</li>
<li>followed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to
the image, and an optional <code>title</code> attribute enclosed in double
or single quotes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reference-style image syntax looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>![Alt text][id]
</code></pre>

<p>Where &ldquo;id&rdquo; is the name of a defined image reference. Image references
are defined using syntax identical to link references:</p>

<pre><code>[id]: url/to/image  &quot;Optional title attribute&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>As of this writing, Markdown has no syntax for specifying the
dimensions of an image; if this is important to you, you can simply
use regular HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3 id="autolink">Automatic Links</h3>

<p>Markdown supports a shortcut style for creating &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have it be a clickable link, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;http://example.com/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Markdown will turn this into:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com/&quot;&gt;http://example.com/&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Automatic links for email addresses work similarly, except that
Markdown will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and hex
entity-encoding to help obscure your address from address-harvesting
spambots. For example, Markdown will turn this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;address@example.com&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>into something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#x6D;&amp;#x61;i&amp;#x6C;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6F;:&amp;#x61;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;
&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#64;&amp;#101;&amp;#120;&amp;#x61;&amp;#109;&amp;#x70;&amp;#x6C;e&amp;#x2E;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;
&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#115;&amp;#115;&amp;#64;&amp;#101;&amp;#120;&amp;#x61;
&amp;#109;&amp;#x70;&amp;#x6C;e&amp;#x2E;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will render in a browser as a clickable link to &ldquo;address@example.com&rdquo;.</p>

<p>(This sort of entity-encoding trick will indeed fool many, if not
most, address-harvesting bots, but it definitely won&rsquo;t fool all of
them. It&rsquo;s better than nothing, but an address published in this way
will probably eventually start receiving spam.)</p>

<h3 id="backslash">Backslash Escapes</h3>

<p>Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal
characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown&rsquo;s
formatting syntax. For example, if you wanted to surround a word
with literal asterisks (instead of an HTML <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag), you can use
backslashes before the asterisks, like this:</p>

<pre><code>\*literal asterisks\*
</code></pre>

<p>Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:</p>

<pre><code>\   backslash
`   backtick
*   asterisk
_   underscore
{}  curly braces
[]  square brackets
()  parentheses
#   hash mark
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>plus sign</li>
<li>minus sign (hyphen)
.   dot
!   exclamation mark</li>
</ul>

      <span class="lead">Tue, Sep 18, 2007</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        I haven't updated my blog in forever and I'm probably going to abandon my homebrew
        static client generated site for something like <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> at
        some point but I haven't had time to make the transition. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, I'd like to save people some pain and document the steps I have go
        through to upgrade my Highpoint RocketRaid 2220 on Linux.&#160; I installed the driver
        a while ago and don't remember the exact steps for that, so this is just what I do
        to upgrade.&#160; I wrote a little shell script: 
    </p>
    <pre>#! /bin/sh -v

# Update this version every time you upgrade.
VER=2.6.15-29-686

# To update the highpoint driver:
# 1) Download latest highpoint driver from: 
#
# http://www.highpoint-tech.com/BIOS_Driver/rr222x/Linux/
#
# 2) Patch driver by changing wrong kernel #ifdefs in osm/linux/os_linux.c  
#   KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,15) -&gt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,16)

# Disable sata_mv.ko by moving it to a new directory.  This driver
# conflicts with highpoint driver.  I don't know if this is the
# "right" way to do this, but it works.
sudo mkdir -p /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled
sudo mv /lib/modules/${VER}/kernel/drivers/scsi/sata_mv.ko /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled/

# Make sure kernel headers are installed
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-${VER}

# Make new hpt driver:
cd ~jbeda/sources/rr222x-linux-src-1.07/product/rr2220/linux/
make KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build
sudo make install KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build

# make a new ramfs
# mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-27-686 /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-686
sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-${VER}</pre>
    <p>
        Good luck. I hope this helps people out there that are stuck with this thing. I'm
        still looking for a good cheap solution to host lots of SATA drives on Linux.&#160;
        Port multipliers are there and aren't as cheap as they should be.&#160; The driver
        situation is pretty dire and there aren't that many non RAID (fake or not) &gt;4 ports
        out there.&#160; I haven't tried any SAS cards though -- perhaps the situation there
        is better.&#160; I'm also running an LSI MegaRAID SATA 300-8XLP with the megaraid
        driver.&#160; It wasn't as cheap but at least it works with a true open driver.&#160;

      <span class="lead">Thu, Aug 3, 2006</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Miguel de Icaza says <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2006/Aug-02.html">"Avalon
        marks the end of the American Dream."</a>&#160; He also compares it to J2EE -- apparently
        implying that it is overly complex and overarchitected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ouch.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I wouldn't put it that way, I can't disagree.&#160; I left Microsoft almost
        two years ago and Avalon still hasn't shipped.&#160; A 5+ year ship cycle for a project
        can't be seen as anything but a sign that something is horribly wrong.&#160; When
        I was on Avalon we kept talking about building an API for the next 10 years.&#160;
        Apparently, when Avalon ships there will be 5 years left on that clock.
    </p>
    <p>
        I take partial responsibility for this.&#160; When we were first starting Avalon,
        I was all about "Go big or go home" and "We should build something only Microsoft
        can build."&#160; In retrospect, the project and the company might have been better
        served by starting with a much smaller team, aiming lower to start and shipping 5
        times over those 5 years.&#160; Version 1 might not have been that impressive, but
        relentless improvement would have built something better factored, simpler, and more
        in tune with what users actually need.
    </p>
    <p>
        I named this blog "eightypercent" in honor of the 80% rule.&#160; It just so happens
        there there are lots of 80% rules to apply.&#160; In this case, a simpler system that
        only solved 80% of the problem would have been good enough and would have shipped
        multiple times already.
    </p>
    <p>
        It looks like the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22WPF%2FE%22&amp;btnG=Search">WPF/E</a> project
        is an effort to&#160;strip Avalon down to something much more approachable.&#160;
        Cross platform, no full CLR, lower memory footprint -- sounds a lot like Flash/Flex.&#160;
        I know some of the guys working on the project and I have high hopes that it will
        be something interesting.&#160; The only question, when will&#160;it ship?

    <p>
        Coming in this morning, I heard a&#160;<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5567184">segment
        on NPR</a> covering a unique program that King Country is running to provide <a href="http://www.desc.org/1811.html">rooms
        for homeless alcoholics</a> in Seattle.&#160; The unique and controversial part of
        this program is that the residents can continue to drink. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My wife, Rachel, has first hand experience with this problem from her work at the
        Harborview ER.&#160;&#160;Some of these "frequent fliers" are indeed part of the community
        at the ER. In fact, one of the patients that Rachel had lots of interactions with
        (ever since she was a med student!) recently died and it really shook her up.&#160;
        Anecdotally, Rachel has seen this program provide a positive impact. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, this novel program seems to me to be a unique way to approach a very
        difficult problem.&#160; It reduces the cost to the taxpayers and provides a safe
        place for these individuals.&#160; Obviously we would all like to see these problems
        solved, but, failing that, at least the county is trying to manage it.

        <li>
            <strong>Automatic</strong>.&#160; A backup system is useless if you don't actually
            use it.&#160; I know that if I'm required to do anything manually it probably won't
            get done. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Off site</strong>.&#160; There are too many things that can happen if you
            have an on site backup.&#160; Your house can burn down, you can get robbed, etc. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Virus resistant</strong>. If somehow a virus were to try and wipe everything
            out, I'd like my&#160;data to survive. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Versioned</strong>.&#160; In case I delete something and don't realize right
            away, I'd like to keep versions of my data. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Big</strong>. I have lots of data and I don't imagine that I'm going to stop
            accumulating it.&#160; I'd like to plan for 800GB-1TB. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>On line</strong>.&#160; I want to be able to get to my backup without mounting/moving
            anything. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is a pretty tall order.&#160; Here are some things that I considered but decided
        not to do: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>RAID</strong>. Mirroring is pretty secure in the face of hardware failure.&#160;
            RAID 5 sounds great but stories I hear is that if one drive goes there is a serious
            chance another will go during the rebuilding.&#160;&#160;Simply doing RAID&#160;also
            fails to satisfy many of the requirements above. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>DVD</strong>.&#160; I started backing some stuff up on DVDs.&#160; I got read
            errors a month later.&#160; Too manual also. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>External Harddrives</strong>. I thought about having a couple of really big
            external drives and rotating them.&#160; This solves a lot of the problems above but
            it is pretty manual.&#160; A friend of mine is going to do this and keep a copy at
            the office.&#160; He said he planned to backup/move every couple of months.&#160;
            That is just too long for me. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>NT Volume Shadow Copy</strong>. This is a cool technology that can keep snapshots
            through time on a drive.&#160; It looks like the Linux Volume Manager (LVM) can do
            some similar things.&#160; This isn't really a backup solution as much as a versioning
            solution.&#160; This plus RAID 0 is probably pretty good except it isn't off site. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I ended up going with a more brute force solution.&#160; I bought and set up two Linux
        servers.&#160; The first is a home server.&#160; The second is in a datacenter in
        downtown Seattle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The home Linux server is a dual core Pentium running Ubuntu 5.10 server.&#160; I have
        a HW/SW raid card driving 5 250GB drives in RAID 5.&#160; It servers a data share
        over Samba.&#160; I backup that share to another directory every night.&#160; That
        archive directory is shared out via Samba also, but as read-only.&#160; This makes
        the situation fairly virus proof.&#160; Since I have two copies of the data (one that
        is r/w and the other that is a backup) I might have to add more drives in the future.&#160;
        I got a big honking case so I'll have room.&#160; I'm running slimserver on this amoung
        other things.&#160; I also use it to do long running batch <a href="http://enblend.sourceforge.net/">enblend</a> stitching
        jobs for panoramas. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The data center machine is a <a href="http://www.tyan.com/products/html/gt20b5151.html">1U
        Tyan server</a> with 4x320GB drives in Linux SW RAID 5.&#160; It is also running Ubuntu
        5.10 server.&#160; (Getting Ubuntu installed on a RAID5 drive array was a challenge.&#160;
        I don't remember the exact steps I took or I would document them here.)&#160; The
        cost of doing this can be high unless you have a friend that can get you hooked up.&#160;
        Even if you can't, it might be worthwhile.&#160; I'm backing up to this every night
        over my cable modem.&#160; The cable modem upload speed is okay since I upgraded to
        Comcast's higher level of service.&#160; I now have ~768kbps up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a couple of choices for software for doing the backups.&#160; The key is
        that it has to be bandwidth smart (only update diffs), handle versioning gracefully
        and be able to do partial copies based on a timer.&#160; The last requirement is so
        that if I have a ton of data to upload it can go over a couple of nights.&#160; The
        most obvious candidate for this is rsync.&#160; rsync is an amazing tool for these
        types of things.&#160; My MS friends think that robocopy is cool -- it can't hold
        a candle to rsync.&#160; It also generally operates over ssh so it is also secure.
        It can also build version trees where unchanged files are hardlinked to previous versions.&#160;
        The only thing it can't do is handle files that have moved but haven't changed, and
        stop itself after a certain number of minutes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, <a href="http://www.scottlu.com/">Scott Ludwig</a> (a coworker
        of mine who has a similar setup) developed a python script that does much of what
        rsync does but solves these two last problems.&#160; It is called "link backup" and
        you can get it <a href="http://www.scottlu.com/Content/Link-Backup.html">here</a>.&#160;
        Every night starting at 11:30pm, I run this backup script to backup my working directory
        to the backup directory on my home server.&#160; This is usually pretty quick.&#160;
        I then backup the latest snapshot of that backup set to the server in the datacenter.&#160;
        This can take a little longer but at least I don't have to think about it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since I implemented this, Amazon's S3 has come on the scene.&#160; While it might
        be interesting to back up using S3, I'm not sure how the economics work out.&#160;
        At my current level (300GB) and Amazon's pricing model ($0.15 per GB per month) I
        would be paying $45 per month.&#160; If I grow to 600GB, I'm up to $90 per month.&#160;
        Bandwidth is extra, but I don't use much of that.&#160; It should be easy to find
        colocation hosting for that amount of coin.&#160; There is the one time cost of the
        hardware and the work of keeping it up to date also (I think my server came in around
        $1600 but I probably overbought).&#160; The advantage is that you can run and do other
        things with your own server in a datacenter.

        I must be getting old because every week I look forward to listening to <a href="http://www.kuow.org/swing_years.asp">The
        Swing Years and Beyond</a> on KUOW, our local NPR station.&#160; It runs from 7-12
        every Saturday and is always fun to listen to.&#160; I'm not an expert in the era
        or anything but Amanda Wilde (and Cynthia Doyon before her) always seem to hit the
        right note.&#160; When I got my Honda Element it came with a free trial for XM radio.&#160;
        They have a&#160;1930s big band/swing station but it just isn't the same.

        My grandmother died recently and listening to this music always reminds me of her.&#160;
        One of the songs they played a couple of weeks ago was "Chattanooga Choo Choo."&#160;
        I can't hear it without thinking of her favorite joke (copied from <a href="http://www.dykerheights.com/jokes.html">here</a>): 
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
    <p>
        Roy Rogers had just purchased a new set of boots. Going out one day to check on Trigger,
        Roy stepped in a pile of ... well suffice it to say that Dale told him to leave his
        boots outside on the porch until he could clean them up. Roy did so and went inside
        for dinner. In the meantime a cougar wandering around on the property spied the boots,
        grabbed them up in his mouth and headed for the wilderness. Roy, seeing his new boots
        heading for the hills, pulled on a pair of old boots, ran out and saddled up Trigger
        and headed for the hills to cut off the escape path of the cougar. Several hours later
        Roy returned, new boots in hand and the cougar stretched over the back of Trigger.
        Dale looking at the scene in front of her said "Pardon me Roy is that the cat that
        chewed your new shoes?" 
    </p>
    </blockquote>

        There are just so many ways my daughter won't get this joke.

        Last night was the first time Annie slept through the night.&#160; We put her to bed
        around 8pm and it is now 6:20am and she is still asleep. We've been working over the
        past couple of nights to eliminate her&#160;late night&#160;feeding and help her to
        get back to sleep on her own.

      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        The second thing that happened today is that we released <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html">libjingle</a> on
        sourceforge.&#160;Full details are up on the <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-all-way.html">Talk
        blog</a>&#160;and at <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-bells.html">code.google.com</a>.
        Sean Egan (of Gaim fame) packaged up the code that Talk uses to do p2p as a library
        for others to use.&#160; Hopefully this will start a flood of interoperable voice
        (and other p2p applications).&#160; So that anyone can use it the code is released
        under a berkeley style license. Sean put together some great docs on how to use the
        new library <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing to keep in mind -- we haven't harmonized the specs and libjingle yet.&#160;
        The goal is to have libjingle implement the spec as it matures.&#160; Right now it
        just interoperates with Talk and is pretty far from the Jingle docs that the JSF released.&#160;
        As the spec moves forward the code will converge.&#160; Most of the differences right
        now are syntax.&#160; For example the underlying technique for punching through NATs
        is unchanged and is an adaptation of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-06.txt">ICE</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've wanted to release this core part of the Talk application for a long time now
        and I'm super excited to see it happen. The combination of these new standards and
        the libjingle library should be pretty potent.&#160; And since&#160;Jingle can be
        used for more than just voice, I'm sure we'll see this stuff used in interesting and
        surprising ways that we never envisioned.
    </p>

        <p>

    <p>
        For serious portraits or low light situations, we've been taking lots of pictures
        of Annie with my Canon 20D.&#160; I also have a Canon SD300 for convience and video.&#160;
        The video modes on these small cameras are amazing!&#160; I can't see myself needing
        more than a couple minutes of video.&#160; Who needs a video camera for their kids
        these days? 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, dealing with the video out of these things can be tricky.&#160; I post my
        pictures to <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">smugmug.com</a> (if you sign up use
        my referrer coupon: <span class="title">aoVCSFuPXSipF</span>).&#160; I've got a plan
        that also lets me upload videos.&#160; The only format they take is MPEG 1 (for compat
        reasons)&#160;but the camera produces MJpeg AVI files.&#160; Converting these things
        can be trickier than you'd think.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is what I've ended up doing -- if someone else has a better solution let me know. 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download 'MPlayer-mingw32-1.0pre7.zip' from <a href="http://www2.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/win32-beta/">here</a>&#160;[7.8M].
            There are a lot of distributions out there but most of the older ones don't work for
            some reason.&#160; This one at least does something reasonable. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Unzip this into a directory.&#160; I put it under an MPlayer dir in my "program files"
            dir. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a batch file with this in it (call it <code>convert-avi.cmd</code> or something):<pre>@echo off
setlocal

set CL=%CL% -oac lavc -ovc lavc -of mpeg -mpegopts format=mpeg1

%CL%</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Call your brand new batch file with the <code>.avi</code> file you need to convert.&#160; It will
            create a file in the current directory with the same name but a <code>.mpg</code> extension.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This command line is totally out of control.&#160; I couldn't find a way to wrap lines
        in batch files so I did the environment variable trick.&#160; I got this via trail
        and error and I'm not sure what all of the options mean, but here is what I know it
        does: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Encodes as MPEG 1 into a .mpg file 
        </li>
        <li>
            Upconverts the audio to 44.1 kHz as that is the only freq I could get to work. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't do any resizing or framerate changes (leaves it at 640x480x30fps for my files) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses a fairly high bitrate to make sure the quality stays good 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For a 18.5 second video doing this compression (just to MPEG1 -- let alone something
        better) cut&#160;a 35M AVI file down to 5.5M.&#160; The only problem I haven't figured
        out is that the first frame is really pixelated.&#160; If you can figure it out you
        win my undying gratitude.&#160; Check out the docs&#160;<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/index.html#toc">here</a> or <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Bonus:</strong> You can rotate the&#160;video during the conversion with a <code>,rotate=90</code> on
        the after <code>harddup</code> on the -vf argument.

    <p>
        I <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/09/02.html">left Microsoft for
        Google</a> one year ago today.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've got to be honest; it was a little scary when I left.&#160; I started at Microsoft
        right out of college after two internships.&#160; Up until a year ago, the lion's
        share of my professional experience had been at Microsoft.&#160; Microsoft can be
        a very comfortable place (much less so since they've been cutting benefits).&#160;
        From the outside, I've also been able to look at Microsoft with different eyes.&#160;
        What I used to rationalize away now appears <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001835.php">absurd
        on the face</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is one year&#160;later and I'm sure that I made the right decision.&#160; I've
        been much happier over the last year at Google.&#160; I'm sure some of it was the
        excitement of just doing something different, but a lot of it really came from the
        energy of those I work with and actually <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249">shipping
        product</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh yeah, and my non-compete and non-solicit contracts with Microsoft have now expired.&#160;
        If you are looking for new challenges feel free to send me a resume.

    <p>
        There have been a lot of questions around Google's approach to federation -- both&#160;in
        the comments on this blog and in other forums (the jdev list, slashdot, etc).&#160;
        I apologize for the delay in responding to these questions head on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We've updated our FAQ to clarify some changes.&#160; To save everyone having to look
        it up in the Google cache, here is the before: 
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="-1">We look forward to federating with any service provider
    who shares our belief in enabling user choice and open communications. We do believe,
    however, that it is important to balance openness with ensuring that we maintain a
    safe and reliable service that protects user privacy and blocks spam and other abuses.
    We are using the federation opportunity with EarthLink and Sipphone to develop a set
    of guidelines by which all members of the federated network can work together to ensure
    that we protect our users while maximizing the reach of the network. [...]</font></blockquote> 
    <p>
        Here is the new text (changes in red): 
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><strong style="COLOR: red">We plan to support open server-to-server
    federation.</strong> We do believe, however, that it is important to <strong style="COLOR: red">have
    the safeguards in place</strong> to ensure that we maintain a safe and reliable service
    that protects user privacy and blocks spam and other abuses. We are using the federation

    maximizing the reach of the network. [...]</font></blockquote> 
    <p>
        On top of that, one of my fellow Google Talk developers, Gary Burd,&#160;has introduced
        himself to the Jabber developer mailing list.&#160; You can read his first post <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2005-August/021792.html">here</a>.

        I, personally, look forward to a long and fruitful partnership between Google and
        the Jabber community.

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00252.html">DVD Review: Yosemite in Winter</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Sat, Aug 27, 2005</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Annie and I watched a DVD this morning while I was feeding her.&#160; Actually, she
        wasn't paying that much attention, but I was.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DVD was <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/">Steve Kossack</a>'s new DVD documenting
        one of his workshops to Yosemite during the winter.&#160; The DVD is what Steve hopes
        will be first of a series: "<span class="style1">Steve Kossack: Photographing the
        Great American Landscape."&#160; This one is titled <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/DVD/index.htm">"Yosemite
        in the&#160;Winter."</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that I have the baby, I don't have the time to go on workshops like this, so this
        is the&#160;next best thing.&#160; If you are interested in landscape photography
        at all, this DVD will be of interest to you.&#160; If you haven't been on a photo
        workshop, the video will give you an idea of what one of those workshops is like --
        without the waking up at 4:30 am to hit a sunrise shoot.&#160; If you are planning
        on doing Yosemite on your own, Steve's DVD will provide an invaluable guide to how
        to approach the area and some great places to shoot.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for Steve himself, I've been on two of his workshops so far (Death Valley and <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/past_ws/past04.htm#landmarks2">Landmarks
        of the Southwest</a>) and both were great.&#160; Steve really knows his stuff -- both
        on the photography side and on the natural and human history of the area.&#160; I've
        never been to Yosemite, but I'd love to go with Steve sometime in the future.

        Microsoft.&#160; It is more forward looking than a lot of the other MS conferences.]

        I'm going to the PDC to keep up with what is going on with Windows.&#160; Drop me
        a line if you'd like to chat about Google Talk or anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not sure which sessions I'm going to attend yet, but I can tell you that my interests
        have shifted somewhat since I've shipped software on the outside.&#160; I'm much more
        interested in stuff that can help make Google Talk better now than more forward looking
        stuff that may not ship for another year yet.&#160; I'm also a lot less interested
        in huge frameworks that tie my product to Windows.&#160; While Google Talk is right
        now just a Windows only application, we've worked hard to keep the Win32 only stuff
        isolated so that it will be easier for us to port/write on other platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, is anyone working on an Avalon/.Net Jabber/XMPP client?&#160; I've
        been looking at the SSL/TLS support in the WinFX SDK and it might be possible to do
        it without any reliance on external libraries.

        We've been working to bring together our new IM service.&#160; Most of the development
        was centered up here in the Kirkland office.&#160; Watch this space (and others) for

    <ul>
        <li>
            Instant messaging server based on the XMPP/Jabber protocol.&#160; This is an IETF

        <li>
            Our own client available for download from <a href="http://talk.google.com">talk.google.com</a>.&#160;
            We've concentrated on a simple to use and clean interface.&#160; We've tried to strip
            IM down to its essence.</li>
        <li>
            Support for voice calls between clients that just work.&#160; We've worked hard to
            support all sorts of network topologies.&#160; We are also using first class industry
            leading audio codecs.</li>
        <li>
            A commitment to openness moving forward.&#160; Choose your platform (Window, Mac,
            Linux, etc), choose your client (ours or others) and choose your service provider
            (we are commited to federation).&#160; We want to make IM as open as the web or email.</li>

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00247.html">Baby: A Programmers View</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Sun, Jul 24, 2005</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        I'm an engineer at heart and I like to understand how things work.&#160; Our new baby, <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/06/25.html#a244">Anne</a>,
        is no exception.&#160; Let's take a programmers approach to understanding this mysterious
        black box. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Inputs (the 5 senses): 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Sight </strong>Anne certainly likes to look around.&#160; My understanding
            is that babies generally see only high contrast at a pretty short distance (1 foot?)&#160;
            She certainly likes looking at faces close up. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sound </strong>Whitenoise is supposed to be soothing.&#160; She also likes
            U2 and (heaven help me) Cher.&#160; Loud.&#160; I think she likes my singing too.&#160;
            I'm not sure why. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Taste </strong>She eats a lot.&#160; I'm not sure how much variation in taste
            she actually gets.&#160; There are theories that the mother's diet can affect the
            milk, but I haven't personally verified that. <em>Ewwww.</em> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Touch </strong>Babies need to be held and touched.&#160; They also need to
            be warm.&#160; One input is swaddling&#160;-- wrapping her tightly so that she can't
            move her arms or legs. Rocking and dancing with her count here too. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Smell </strong>Smell is supposed to be one of the most powerful senses.&#160;
            I've yet to see her react to any smells specifically, but I'm sure she is paying attention. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Outputs: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Biological Outputs</strong> Doctors are funny creatures.&#160;&#160; They
            are really concerned about all forms of matter escaping from our bodies: liquid, solid
            or gas.&#160; Parents also pay close attention to this.&#160; The amount, type and
            origin seem to be important clues to understanding the baby. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cries </strong>She has many and varied cries.&#160; Some of them are short
            yelps to draw attention while others are reports of murder nearby.&#160; Then there
            is the scary quivering lower lip.&#160; This is supposedly normal and a byproduct
            of her immature nervous system.&#160; It just kills me to see her do it though. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Posture </strong>The way she holds her body is an important clue.&#160; If
            she is curled up like a bug or stretched out and rigid means something. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Eyes and Face </strong>Her eyes and face are very expressive.&#160; Almost
            too expressive.&#160; She goes through a facial expression every 5 seconds or so. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sleep</strong> You'd think that it would be easy to tell if she is asleep
            or not.&#160; It really isn't though.&#160; She can be sleeping with her eyes closed
            or just pretending to sleep so that the minute you put her down she perks right up
            again. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There you have it&#160;-- 5 inputs and 5 outputs.&#160; Sounds like a pretty simple
        system to me.&#160; The problem is that she is indeed a very complex state machine.&#160;
        She is so complex that there is no way to map the effect of the inputs (feeding her,
        for example) to the outputs (her current crying state).&#160; One would think that
        it would be easy to empirically derive causal relationships between certain inputs
        and certain outputs.&#160; Nope. She has more states than a Rubik's cube (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube">43,252,003,274,489,856,000</a>).
        The baby is indeed a very complex creature that does not yield her secrets to such

        it can understand.&#160; It has adapted to the baby and somehow we're able make it

        Where can I download a debug version of Firefox?&#160; It just started crashing on

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00243.html">On Talking to the Media</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Sat, Jun 18, 2005</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Once in a while I get approached by a reporter (either local newspaper or national
        business magazine) to comment on some story.&#160; I'm really not sure why they&#160;approach
        a B list blogger like me (how long since I last posted?) but it probably has something
        to do with the fact that I'm one of the only bloggers that went from Microsoft to
        Google.&#160; If there is a story that involves Google and Microsoft, my name seems
        to come up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My standard answer to any requests like this is that I can't comment.&#160; Here is
        the mail I sent in response to a message last night: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>Hi XXX, 
    <p>
        As much as I would love to help you out on your story, it is probably best for me
        to not comment on stuff like this. I want to keep my discourse on Microsoft (especially
        compared to my current employer) as positive as possible. I'm afraid that any thing
        that I might say would come across as "Microsoft bashing." This isn't just the Google
        PR dept. talking either -- I really want to take the high road. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm sorry that I can't be of more help. Good luck with your story. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Joe 
    </p>
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
        The funny part is that <strong>talking to the media has absolutely no upside</strong> for
        me.&#160;If I had something important to say, I would much rather post it here on
        my blog and let people link to it and forward it around if they find it interesting.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Reasons to blog over talking to a reporter:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>My voice gets through unfiltered</strong>.&#160; No matter how hard they try,
            I've seen reporters misinterpret what I and others have said again and again.&#160;
            I'm sure most of them think that they are faithfully transmitting the meaning of the
            primary source, but they invariably change the meaning along the way -- in some small
            (or large) way.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>I want the link traffic</strong>.&#160; Flow is the currency of the blogging
            world.&#160; Talking to a reporter gets me no flow.&#160; Even when they mention my
            blog (rarely) they almost never link to it.&#160; It seems like they just don't get
            how the web works.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Talking to a reporter could get me fired</strong>.&#160; Google really doesn't
            want me talking to reporters.&#160; Blogging is walking a fine line that requiring
            a healthy dose common sense; but talking to reporters is suicidal.&#160; The problem
            again is that what the reporter writes isn't necessarily what you thought you were
            saying.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>No mountains out of mole hills.<em> </em></strong>Writing something on your
            blog that people find interesting enough to link to and pass around is hard!&#160;
            The real time web (new name for the blog-o-sphere) is a very hard filter.&#160; While
            the media can produce its own buzz, it takes real work and something truly interesting
            to make an impact on the much more democratic medium that is the true internet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So -- reporters -- feel free to send me email.&#160; I'll happily respond in a polite
        way.&#160; But don't count on getting any comments out of me that I'm not willing
        to share on my blog.&#160; And I'd much rather put them on my blog in the first place.

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00242.html">High Dynamic Range and the Quality of the Pixel</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Sun, May 8, 2005</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        I wasn't going to upgrade to Photoshop CS2 because I didn't think that I need it.&#160;
        But that was&#160;before I found out about the new support for High Dynamic Range
        (HDR) and 32 bits per&#160;channel floating point support.&#160; Michael Reichmann
        over at The Luminous Landscape has an <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/hdr.shtml">article</a> talking
        about the new "Merge to HDR".&#160; I was going to how current cameras only handle
        6 stops and all (and what a stop is) but Michael does a good job of that in his article.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm excited about this feature because I think that it will enable me to capture images
        that I haven't been able to before.&#160; I've often shot bracketed exposures with
        the thought that I would merge them together by hand later. The results rarely are
        as good as I imagined when I took the image.&#160; For instance, shooting a sunrise
        of a mountain where the top of the mountain is in the sun but the rest is in shadow
        can be very difficult.&#160; Having a tool that approaches this in a more methodical
        way is exciting.&#160; On top of this, I'm excited by the possibilities of this combined
        with panoramic photography.&#160; Wide angle and pano photography has a problem whereby
        you are taking in so much of a scene that you are much more likely to have parts of
        the image be very bright and others be very dark.&#160; One of the skills that I've
        been developing is the ability to pick a scene where I won't run in to these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, as great as the new Photoshop might be, there are other parts of the digital
        photography system that need to catch up.&#160; The first is on the display side.&#160;
        While the data in a photograph might contain lots of dynamic range, today's displays
        can't show it all.&#160; That is going to change over the next couple of years.&#160;
        On the software side, there is plumbing being laid to support 32bpp through the Windows
        desktop and to the video driver.&#160; (The 3D APIs and graphics cards are support
        a lot of this already because it can be useful in 3D rendering).&#160; The displays
        are going to get better also.&#160; Over the next couple of years, expect to see wide
        gamut and HDR screens coming out.&#160; Sunnybrook is one of the companies that has
        been pioneering this <a href="http://www.sunnybrooktech.com/hdr/index.html">LED based
        display technology</a>.&#160; Where&#160;normal LCD or CRT displays can get a contrast
        ratio of 300-400:1, they claim their LED technology can get 60,000:1.&#160; That means
        the bright spots are brighter and the shadows are darker.&#160; I haven't seen one
        of these displays myself, but I'm super excited by the technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other side that needs to improve is on the image capture side.&#160; I have not
        specific knowledge of any plans from any camera manufacturers, but it is obvious that
        the megapixel race is slowing down.&#160; We are reaching the limits of the glass.&#160;
        Another example is the fact that the new prosumer level Nikon SLRs are still only
        6 megapixel.&#160; It is clear that the camera makers are going to compete on more
        than just the <em>number of pixels</em>.&#160; They will start competing on the <em>quality
        of those pixels</em>. This is going to be very exciting.&#160; We are entering a world
        where digital cameras are not just&#160;matching the abilities of film cameras, but
        they are on the verge of surpassing them.&#160; A camera that can capture higher dynamic
        range and a wider gamut?&#160; Sign me up!
    </p>
    <p>
        The big question in my mind is the print making side of the equation.&#160; When I
        print my photos, I usually send them out (<a href="http://www.whcc.com/">WHCC</a>&#160;or <a href="http://www.westcoastimaging.com/">WCI</a>)
        to be printed on a Chromira printer.&#160; This is a printer that uses LEDs to expose
        regular photo paper.&#160; This photo paper is then printed traditionally.&#160; The
        gamut of these devices (and that of the ink jet processes) can be larger than current
        displays but is still fairly limited.&#160; The dynamic range of all of these output
        devices is pretty low compared to what can be done with an emissive display device.&#160;
        The bottom line is that the printing technology isn't keeping up with the rest of
        the system.&#160; What does this mean in the long term?&#160; I'm not sure but we
        will start to see a vast divergence between the quality of an image when displayed
        on a good monitor compared to they quality of an image when printed.
    </p>
    <p>
        It certainly is an exciting time for photography...

        Rachel (my wife for those of you not playing along at home) has been struggling to
        get parking passes for our cars.&#160; In our neighborhood in Seattle, you need a
        permit to park on the street for longer than 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        How hard can it be to get this pass?&#160;&#160;The <a href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/transportation/parking/parkingrpz.htm">website</a>&#160;says
        "to have an application mailed to you, please call (206) 684-5086."
    </p>
    <p>
        The response at that number: "We're sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is
        full"<br />
        Two days later: "We're sorry, but the voice mailbox for this number is full."
    </p>
    <p>
        So Rachel decides that this isn't working and goes downtown, parks (no easy task)
        and treks up to the 37th floor of the Seattle Municipal Tower.&#160; Let me set the
        scene for you.&#160; There are two workers helping citizens with their Traffic Permit
        needs.&#160; There is a third that gets up to help Rachel.&#160; Then there is a rotund
        woman sitting next to a ringing phone.&#160; I wasn't there but I imagine that she
        had an unpleasant look on her face.&#160; Let's call her Bertha.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Rachel:</em>&#160;"I'd like to get my zone parking permit"<br />
        <em>Helpful Dude:</em> "Great!&#160; Do you have your forms filled out and your check
        ready?"<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em> "No.&#160; I tried calling to get the form but the voice mailbox
        was full."<br />
        <em>Bertha (who chimes in from her chair next to a ringing phone):</em> "Well it isn't
        full now."<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em> "I called twice and it was full both times."<br />
        <em>Bertha: </em>"I just emptied it.&#160; It wouldn't be full if you people didn't
        call so much."<br />
        <em>Rachel: </em>"The website instructed me to call.&#160; Why don't you guys just
        put a PDF of the form on the website so that people don't have to call?"<br />
        <em>Guy in next line: </em>"That sounds like a great idea!"<br />
        <em>Bertha:</em> "Nah, that would never work.&#160; People wouldn't know how to download
        it or they would screw it up and it would just create more work for us."<br />
        <em>Rachel:</em>&#160;"All right then.&#160; I'll just get my pass and be on my way.&#160;
        I see that I've done all that I can do here."

      <span class="lead">Fri, Apr 15, 2005</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        The <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/04/14.html#a238">20% BoF session
        at CFP</a> last night was fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most interesting thing for me was the questions about how 20% time works.&#160;
        Hopefully I can repeat some of them and the answers here.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How will this scale as Google gets bigger? </strong>I don't know.&#160; What
        I've seen of Google management is that they are committed to keeping the same atmosphere
        as the company grows.&#160; As problems crop up (and I'm sure they will) I'm sure
        that Google will look for "non-traditional" solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you track this?&#160; What if someone is spending 30% of their time
        on a side project? </strong>There isn't really official tracking of this sort of thing.&#160;
        It really comes down to trust of the employee.&#160; At the end of the day (or year)
        you have to list what you've accomplished for your review.&#160; If you've wasted
        your time then you have nothing to talk about on your review.&#160; Keep in mind that
        failures aren't the same as doing nothing -- valuable knowledge is gained.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do you make sure that people are using the time wisely?&#160; How does
        this relate to the goals of the division/group/etc?</strong> Well -- that is just
        it -- you don't know if the time is being used wisely.&#160; You want the engineer
        to do what <em>he/she</em> thinks is the next big thing, not what management thinks.&#160;
        Most people want to do the next cool think that will fire people up both inside and
        outside the company and may end up making Google money.&#160; If you think that the
        best way for you to add value with your 20% time is to slack off and do nothing than
        that really speaks for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What is the goal for this?&#160; Isn't this just a morale booster? </strong>For
        some people I'm sure that this is just a morale booster.&#160; My impression, from
        the short time I've been at Google, is that 20% time is more than that.&#160; Most
        people want to add value by doing stuff that is far easier to do inside someplace
        like Google than anywhere else.&#160; My feeling is that I want to use the time wisely
        to add value in new and unexpected ways for the company.&#160; There is a pretty fluid
        path for these projects, if they show promise, to get funded with full time engineers.&#160;
        That path is critical if a 20% project ends up being super successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Where do you find 20% to spare? I can't cut 20% of my features or slip my
        project by 20%.</strong>&#160; I think that there is more time then you think.&#160;
        If you do "research"&#160;in&#160; a lightweight way like this perhaps you can take
        the time elsewhere.&#160; Also keep in mind that happy engineers are more productive
        engineers.&#160; And stop going to so many meetings -- and if you do have meetings,
        don't allow people to sit in the back and read their email.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What about using 20% time as a reward for exceptional performers?&#160; What
        about&#160;taking away&#160;20% time for&#160;those who don't use it wisely? </strong>I'm
        not a huge fan of these ideas for a couple of reasons.&#160; First, some of the best
        ideas come from people who are looking at something with fresh eyes.&#160; If we make
        it a reward it may be too late to capture that.&#160; As for punishing people, I would
        think that this would have a chilling affect.&#160; We want people to try wacky things
        that no one else has thought of.&#160; Having some missteps is bound to happen and
        we don't want&#160;people to be afraid to experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why 20%?&#160; Why not 50%? or 10%? </strong>I'm not sure.&#160; My guess
        is that either someone took it out of thin air or some math PhD at Google has a proof
        somewhere.&#160; If anyone reads this and knows I'd love to here the answer.
    </p>

        <strong>How do you allocate the time?&#160; Is it one day a week?&#160; 1.6 hours
        a day? 2 weeks a year and a weekend a month? </strong>From what I've seen so far,
        it is up to the engineer to figure this out.&#160; People can save it up and use it
        a month at a time if they like.&#160; My personal strategy is to spend some a week
        or two really getting some momentum behind something and then switching to a more
        integrated schedule.&#160; As project hit shipping mode and such these things may
        take a back seat while the time accrues.&#160; Keep in mind that no one is watching
        over your shoulder with a stopwatch.<br />

        One thing that I want to emphasize (and it came up multiple times last night) is that
        a lot of this comes down to <strong>trust</strong>.&#160; One of the big parts of
        the secret sauce here is that Google really trusts its&#160;engineers and, from what
        I've seen, the engineers live up to those expectations.

        That is always fun.&#160; I'm always amazed at the flow and I love the influx of comments
        both on Slashdot itself and on my blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        One comment was from "Dave B" asking me to elaborate on some theories as to why C++
        hasn't developed the same set of libraries that other environments such as Perl, Python,
        Java, C#, etc. have.&#160; Here are a bunch of ideas.&#160; I have no empirical data
        but just gut feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
        First off, we must examine the philosophy behind different environments.&#160; I may
        be making broad generalizations here, but stay with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Java and the CLR (C#, VB.Net): "Make the easy things easy and make the hard things
            possible."&#160; These environments try to avoid the inherit complexity that C++ has.</li>
        <li>
            Python and Perl (and perhaps others that I have no experience with): "Make my life
            easier -- I don't want to spend more time writing this fast and dirty script than
            I have to".&#160; Above all else users here prize being able to get something useful
            done now.</li>
        <li>
            C++:&#160; "Give me all of the fundamental tools and building blocks and I'll do it
            myself."&#160; Power trumps all.&#160; Templates and the way that people use them
            are a great example of this.</li>
        <li>
            (I'm sure that there are more categories for things like Lisp and Smalltalk.&#160;
            Filling out that part of the list is left as an exercise to the reader)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With this difference in philosophy it is no wonder that there is such - ahem - diversity
        in the C++ library space.&#160; Here are some more thoughts.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There *are* good sets of libraries out there for doing stuff.&#160; One example would
            be <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a>.&#160; These have limited uptake I think
            for a couple of reasons.&#160; First, downloading and building these is a pain.&#160;
            They don't already come with your compiler.&#160; Second, these libraries are either
            laser focused on a specific area (libtiff?) or are more collections/algorithms base.&#160;
            Boost, for example, doesn't include an easy interface for dealing with zip files or
            for writing a single threaded select loop based network server.</li>
        <li>
            The C++ standards process is slow and ponderous.&#160; While there are downsides to
            these environments being controlled by a single entity or a focused group, but the
            end result is much faster advancement of the language/runtime/environment.</li>
        <li>
            There are so many ways to do things in C++ that invariably arguments come up over
            how to do something. Even within one company, people can't agree.&#160; For some reason
            C++ programmers seem to be more stubborn on a lot of these points.&#160;&#160;The
            result is that&#160;everyone just writes their own thing.</li>
        <li>
            It is way to easy to write super hard to use APIs in C++.&#160; Templates make this
            problem worse.&#160; If you do this stuff day in and day out you get to know it and
            it makes sense to you, but most C++ libraries are hard to use on a casual basis.&#160;
            I think that there is a disease where people think that it is their obligation to
            use templates in as confusing a way as possible.&#160; Any time a class has a templated
            base class, you are going to go right over the head of 95% of the developers out there.</li>
        <li>
            Opinions are divided around RTTI and exceptions.&#160; Code written to deal with exceptions
            doesn't interop well with code that turns exceptions off.&#160; Almost no one turns
            on RTTI.&#160; In any case, the result is that these are walls to reusing code.&#160;
            If you don't use exceptions you have to come up with your own error code space or
            use platform concepts like HRESULTs.</li>
        <li>
            Everyone likes to replace their allocator but there is no standard way to do that
            for various libraries.&#160; <em>If</em> library lets your replace the allocator it
            is usually something that has to be done on a library by library basis.&#160; So many
            problems would be solved if the CRT and language had a way to do global hooking of
            the malloc/free and new/delete at the link level.</li>
        <li>
            DLLs, shared libraries, compiler differences, differing STL support all make it harder
            to do things in a standard way.</li>
        <li>
            Windows doesn't have a good standard build system.&#160; The upshot is that libraries
            are only on Unix or the Windows build is cobbled together.&#160; Environments like
            Cygwin are really poor compromises.&#160; It would be better for everyone if the unix
            make/configure systems would be updated to work natively on Windows also. It isn't
            like Windows can change anytime soon without breaking the world.&#160; The MS compilers
            are now free -- the make system is really the only missing part now.</li>
        <li>
            Each codebase has its own way for deciding how header files are included.&#160; Figuring
            stuff like that out is just a headache.</li>
        <li>
            Lots and lots of different string types.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Does this hurt C++?&#160; Probably not -- it is just targeted at a different audience.&#160;
        When you need the power you need the power.&#160; If you have to hunt around for example
        code or a helper library and somehow jam it in to your build system and project then
        that is the price for playing the game.

        on how he *thinks* 20% time works.&#160; In the comments Tony backs down because he
        doesn't have specific knowledge of how things work at Microsoft.&#160; I'd like to
        add some more comments to this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Google model of development is more than just information sharing and the ability
        to switch projects.&#160; Here are the important points as I've seen.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There is, by and large, only one code base at Google.&#160; This has many advantages.&#160;
            Most obvious is that it is really easy to look at and contribute to code in other
            projects without having to talk to anyone, get special permissions or fill out forms
            in triplicate.&#160; That is just the tip of the iceberg, though.&#160; Having one
            codebase means that there is a very high degree of code sharing.&#160; Need to base
            64 encode/decode something?&#160; No problem, there is a standard Google routine for
            that.&#160; Found a bug?&#160; Just fix it and check it in after getting it code reviewed
            by a documented owner.&#160; One of the reasons that environments like Perl, Python,
            C#, Java, etc. flourish is that they have large and well through out libraries of
            useful code.&#160; For a variety of reasons, C++ has never had this.&#160; (I could
            theorize but that would be off topic.)&#160; Google has solved this problem by building
            up a large library of well documented and easy to integrate code.&#160; This not only
            lowers the bar for new projects but makes it easy to switch projects as you don't
            have to learn new conventions.</li>
        <li>
            Switching teams at Google is a very fluid process.&#160; An&#160;engineer&#160;can
            be 40% on one project, 40% on something completely different and 20% on his or her
            own thing.&#160; That mix can be adjusted as project requirements change.&#160; Switching
            groups should also not have an affect on your annual review score because of arbitrary
            team politics.&#160;&#160;&#160;Joining a new group is more about find a good mutual
            fit then going through HR and a formal interview loop.&#160; When there is an important
            project that needs to be staffed the groups and execs will evangelize that need and
            someone who is interested is bound to step up.&#160; If it is critical to the business
            and no one is stepping up (I don't know if this has occurred or not) then I imagine
            it would go come down to a personal appeal by the management team.</li>
        <li>
            The intranet in Google is super transparent.&#160; Teams are actively encouraged to
            share the most intimate details of their projects with the rest of the company.&#160;
            This happens through tech talks, design docs, lunch table conversations, etc.&#160;
            When two teams are doing similar things, people start with the assumption that they
            must have their reasons and that the situation will be worked out in time.&#160; There
            isn't a huge push to over optimize and have only one solution for each problem.&#160;
            This means that there isn't an adversarial relationship between teams that can lead
            to long standing animosities and information hiding.</li>
        <li>
            There is a big difference between&#160;pet projects being permitted and being encouraged.&#160;
            At Google it is actively encouraged for engineers to do a 20% project.&#160; This
            isn't a matter of doing something in your <em>spare time, </em>but more of actively
            making time for it.&#160; Heck, I don't have a good 20% project yet and I need one.&#160;
            If I don't come up with something I'm sure it could negatively impact my review.</li>
        <li>
            The intrapersonal environment at Google is very energizing. When someone comes up
            with a new idea, the most common response is excitement and a brainstorming session.&#160;
            Politics and who owns what&#160;area rarely enter into it.&#160; I don't think that
            I've seen anyone really raise their voice and get into a huge knockdown drag out fight
            since coming to Google.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Can 20% time work at other companies? I'm sure that there are going to be others that
        try.&#160; However, I think that it is important to realize that it is a result of
        an environment and philosophy to development more than a cause.&#160; I don't think
        that it is something that can be imposed in an independent way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd like to stress that these comments are my own and aren't any sort of official
        word from Google.&#160; Please don't draw any grand conclusions of corporate strategy
        and such.

        Okay -- when people <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jbeda/231/#231881">ask
        me</a> to update in my comments it has probably been too long. I don't have anything
        super pithy to say, so I guess I'll just use the shotgun approach: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everything is going good with the baby.&#160; Rachel is starting to get big!&#160;
            We are reading to her every night and trying to get our lives in order so that we
            are ready.&#160; We are almost through "The Witch and the Wardrobe." We've been reading
            a chapter each night.&#160; After we are done we will continue reading the rest of
            the <a href="http://www.narnia.com/">Narnia</a> stories out loud&#160;to each other
            and the baby.&#160; I know she can't understand what is going on but I want her to
            know my voice. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We went to Chicago last weekend.&#160; My Sister threw Rachel a baby shower at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/chicagorc/">Ritz-Carlton</a> downtown.&#160;
            The service in the garden was wonderful.&#160; My sister's two girls had an especially
            great time. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I've been buying some cool stuff.&#160; The first is my <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/28.html#a224">terabyte
            array</a> for my main computer.&#160; I ended up with five 300GB SATA drives in a
            cage running software RAID 5.&#160; That comes out to ~1.2TB after you factor out
            the redundency.&#160; I didn't get a dedicated machine to keep costs down.&#160; I
            can always do that later and move the drives over.&#160; Everything has been running
            like a champ. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Also to prepare I picked up a Canon <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=145&amp;modelid=10599">SD300</a>.&#160;
            This is an update to our aging <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/s100.html">S100</a> (the
            original digital Elph) point and shoot.&#160; It is amazing how much these things
            have improved.&#160; I loved the S100 but the SD300 is <em>so</em> much better.&#160;
            My favorite feature is that it can do 640x480x30fps movies until the card is full.&#160;
            For short clips there is no reason to get a video camera.&#160; I also ordered a 1GB
            SD card but those are apparently sold out everywhere. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm thinking about getting a new car as the baby approaches.&#160; I want to take
            a serious look at the <a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/models/model_overview.asp?ModelName=Element">Honda
            Element</a>.&#160; Having an interior made of rubber that you can hose down sound
            like a good idea with kids. Plus, it is only $21k completely decked out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Between Rachel and me, we've recently read the entire <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=raymond+chandler">Raymond

            ooze from the pages. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I haven't been taking many photos lately.&#160; I have some more stuff&#160;from the&#160;<a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/11/27.html">Arizona

            Work has been going great.&#160; I still can't talk about what I'm working on but
            I really feel like I've made it over the hump of moving to a new environment and I'm
            starting to be really productive.&#160; The contrast between Google and Microsoft
            couldn't be greater (at least from an engineer's point of view).&#160; No meetings
            and few politics means that I spend much more time coding.&#160; I've written more
            code so far at Google than I have in the last year at MS.&#160; (That really isn't
            apples to apples as I spent most of my time in the last year at MS writing specs.)&#160;
            I totally feel like I'm in the loop on my project without having to play political
            games.&#160; I guess that is what happens on smaller teams.

        Good news!&#160; We are having a baby.&#160; My wife is pregnant. I know that people
        usually say "we are pregnant" but she is the one that went through the nausea and
        has to deal with carrying the baby around for 9 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ultrasound from this morning looks good.&#160; It is still pretty early yet (she
        is 17 weeks along -- due date is June 21st) but the ultrasound tech said that it looked
        like our baby is a girl.

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00226.html">DOS/Windows command line escaping</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Sun, Dec 5, 2004</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Here is a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">Raymond</a>-esque tidbit that
        I wanted to get out there.&#160; I couldn't find anything on Google and had to figure
        this stuff out via trail and error. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Okay -- you think you know how to escape stuff on the DOS/Windows command line?&#160;
        Probably not.&#160; Let's start with a simple python script to show us what we've
        got: 
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;type dumpargs.py
# a simple program to dump the incoming arguments
import sys
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    print repr(arg)
</pre>
    <p>
        Now lets run some tests and see what it spits out: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there"
'hi there'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi \" there"
'hi " there'</pre>
    <p>
        So far so good. It looks like we know how to escape a double quote sign ("). But what
        about the pesky percent sign? DOS/Windows/Command/CMD uses this for variable substitution.
        Let's try a bunch of stuff and see what we get: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;set foo=bar

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there %foo%"
'hi there bar'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \%foo\%"
'hi there \\%foo\\%'</pre>
    <p>
        Hmmm, it looks like the backslash doesn't work. Looking around, it looks like the
        caret symbol (^) is the way to go. Lets try that out. 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py ^%foo^%
'%foo%'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there ^%foo^%"
'hi there ^%foo^%'</pre>
    <p>
        Well, it looks like that works as long as it isn't in quotes. I also found another
        wacky case: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \" ^%foo^%"
'hi there " %foo%'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there \" \" ^%foo^%"
'hi there " " ^%foo^%'</pre>
    <p>
        Very odd -- it looks like the caret does work as an escape character as long as there
        is an odd number of escaped double quote characters before it in the string. The parser
        here is obviously not a simple as one might first think. Lets try ending the string
        before we quote the percent sign: 
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi there %foo% bar'

C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi \" there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi " there ^%foo^% bar'</pre>
    <p>
        We are getting closer, but that escaped quote character puts the parser into a wacky
        state. I finally did find a good solution: 
    </p>
    <pre>C:\test&gt;dumpargs.py "hi "^"" there "^%"foo"^%" bar"
'hi " there %foo% bar'</pre>
    <p>
        It turns out that you must replace the double quote (") with the following sequence:
        "^"". You must also quote the percent character (%) with this sequence: "^%". I think
        that everything else is okay inside of the double quotes. Very strange but true. I
        guess this is what 20 years of back compat get you.

        This was a pretty lean day on the workshop.&#160; This was our day to go and hike
        out to "the wave."&#160; The Wave is a really cool set of sandstone rock formations
        buried in the north part of <a href="http://www.az.blm.gov/paria/cbusereg2.html">Coyote
        Buttes</a>.&#160; A permit is required to hike Coyote Buttes and the BLM restricts
        it to 10 people per day.&#160; The problem is that on the weather had taken a turn
        for the worse during the night.&#160; When we work up at 5 AM on Sunday, it was raining
        in page.&#160; As we drove toward the trailhead we gained elevation and it started
        snowing.&#160; Around 6 AM we needed to start driving on gravel roads.&#160; It was
        still snowing pretty hard and we decided to turn back.&#160; I was looking forward
        to a good hike and was disappointed that we didn't make it to the Wave. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When we got back to the motel, we picked up everyone else and went "hunting."&#160;
        Off the side of the road outside of Page, as we were climbing, we stopped to photograph
        some fresh snow on desert trees.&#160; This is one of the images that resulted. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical details: Original composition was 24 images (8x3).&#160; I cropped out just
        a corner of that to make the composition as seen above.&#160; Total images used then
        is probably more like 15 (5x3).&#160; Each was shot at 1/25 sec, f/11, ISO 100 with
        the 24-70 f/2.8L @ 50mm.&#160; Final image is 6000x6000 or 36 megapixel.

        I know it seems hard to believe in this day and age of 300GB hard drives, but I've
        run out of hard drive space.&#160; My plan up until now was to keep a bunch of stuff
        on a <s>RAID 0</s> RAID 1 (RAID0 is simple striping with no redundency. RAID 1 is
        mirrored.) 120GB set of drives.&#160; As that fills up, I've been archiving stuff
        to DVD.&#160; The problem is that I've had to start archiving stuff sooner than I
        thought and I don't trust the DVDs.&#160; In fact, I've gotten read errors on some
        already.&#160; They may be fine for video, but I don't want to archive data on them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm faced with a couple of options.&#160; The first option is to half ass it some
        more and put a couple of more drives into my current computer.&#160; I'm hoping the
        power supply can take it.&#160; I think I can fit them in there but it may be tight.&#160;
        Thank god for serial ATA at least.&#160; I don't think I could fit them in with regular
        old parallel ATA.&#160; A Maxtor 300GB SATA drive is urrently $206 at newegg.&#160;
        300GB more (mirrored) would be a good start, but I'm sure I'd run out of space sooner
        or later. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The other options I was thinking about was putting together a storage server and running
        RAID 5 (stripe set with parity -- it spreads the data across multiple drives but duplicates
        some of the data for redundency).&#160; I'd like something that I can grow with so
        I'd like to be able to increase the amount of space for just the cost of more drives.&#160;
        Here is what I came up with: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Computer guts: 
            <ul>

                    The <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=16-125-005&amp;depa=0">Broadcom
                    card</a> is another option but it is $100 more.&#160; Tom's hardware did an <a href="http://www6.tomshardware.com/storage/20041006/index.html">interesting
                    expriment</a> with these where they drove 32 drives off of one computer. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-145-049&amp;depa=0">80GB
                    system drive</a> ($60)&#160; You generally don't want to run the OS off of your data
                    array. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-359&amp;depa=0">4&#160;*
                    Maxtor 300GB 7200RPM SATA drives w/ 16MB buffer</a> (4&#160;* $206 = $824).&#160;
                    This seems to be a sweet spot in capacity right now. The 250GB drives aren't that
                    much cheaper and the 400GB drives are super expensive.&#160; The Maxtor also comes
                    with a 3 year warranty. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Total price: <strong>$1913</strong> plus shipping and software.&#160; I'd probably
        run Windows as I think I have a legit copy of SBS 2k3 that MS gave me when I still
        worked there.&#160; It should run Linux fine too if all you want to do is serve files. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With RAID 5 this will give me ~900GB of redundant storage.&#160; I can easily double
        the size with another hard drive cage and a set of drives ($942).&#160; This seams
        like a pretty wild deal to me.&#160; Sure it won't be the fastest thing out there
        but it is pretty darn cheap for a ton of storage.&#160; I probably won't drop the
        money on something like this for a while, so I'm expecting it to just get cheaper. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, am I missing anything?&#160; Is someone going to come out with a turnkey system
        for half the price?&#160; The closest comparable thing I could find where the NAS
        systems that various people are selling.&#160; Nothing could touch this setup on price.&#160;
        I looked at the Apple XServe (I do love blinking lights...) but they start at $6000
        for 1TB and require fiber channel.&#160; Way overkill for me.&#160; There is also
        something like the <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10462">LaCie
        terrabyte drive</a>&#160;($1000).&#160; This seems like an amazingly bad idea to me.&#160;
        They must 4 drives in there.&#160; If one fails you loose all of your data.&#160;
        The chances of loosing all of your data is 4 times as likely. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I like pricing out stuff like this even though I may never buy it :)

      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Last weekend I spent some time down near Page, AZ photographing some beautiful southwest
        scenery.&#160; Since I don't have the time or experience to plan something like this
        myself, I went with a group of people led by <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/about.htm">Steve
        Kossack</a>&#160;from <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/">f-8 and be there</a>.&#160;
        Steve takes people out on photography workshops to places that he knows very well.&#160;
        It is&#160;amazing what a difference an experienced leader can make to an expedition.&#160;
        I had a great time and got some amazing images from the trip. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My flight to Phoenix on Thursday got in around 1:30 pm.&#160; Steve and some of the
        other participants picked me up at the airport baggage claim.&#160; We were then immediately
        off on a pretty long drive up to Page.&#160; Page is right on the border between Arizona
        and Utah.&#160; It's on <a href="http://www.powellguide.com/lakepowell/lakepowellmap.html">Lake
        Powell</a>, a huge serpentine lake made by the Glen Canyon Dam.&#160; The Glen Canyon
        dam is on the Colorado upstream from the Grand Canyon. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once at page, we checked in to a hotel and started our 3 days of intense field photography.&#160;
        A typical day would be getting up early enough so that we could be at a good spot
        for sunrise.&#160; Up in the high desert this was pretty cold this time of year.&#160;
        Lows at night were somewhere around 35-40 degrees F.&#160; We would then photograph
        the sunrise.&#160; After that we would spend the day in locations that work well with
        overhead light.&#160; For this trip we photographed both upper and lower Antelope
        Canyons.&#160; These are amazing slot canyons that really have to be seen to be believed.&#160;
        As the day wears on we would travel to another amazing location for a sunset shoot. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides the wonderful landscapes, the other people on a trip like this make it a very
        enriching experience.&#160; It is refreshing to me to be out with people who enjoy
        photography so much.&#160; It takes a certain type of person to get up at 4:30am in
        the cold so that you can travel two hours to be in time for the morning light.&#160;
        One part of the workshop that I particularly enjoy is the print discussion.&#160;
        Steve encourages everyone to bring some prints of their work.&#160; Then, after living
        with each other for a couple of days, we get together to admire and discuss each others'
        work.&#160; Steve also brings some of his best work for us to look at. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in an experience like this and have&#160;a passion for photography,
        give Steve a call.&#160; His upcoming <a href="http://www.f-8andbethere.com/workshops/rafting05.htm">Grand
        Canyon rafting trip</a> looks like a trip of a lifetime.&#160; I won't be able to
        make this one, but it looks like he has a couple of spots left. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the images that I got -- here is a start: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Horseshoe Bend at dawn" hspace="0" src="http://static.eightypercent.net/photos/HSB-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /> 
    </p>
    <p>
        This is famous Horseshoe Bend on the Colorado river.&#160; The river&#160;carves a
        perfect circle as seen from&#160;the cliff overlooking the canyon.&#160; This was
        our first sunrise of the trip.&#160; I'm always a little rusty when starting out on
        something like this, but I'm happy with this result.&#160; The mountains in back (catching
        the sun first) are called the Vermillion Cliffs. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical details: 20 images stitched together (3x7) shot from my Canon 20D with the
        24-70mm f/2.8L at 34mm.&#160; Exposure was 1/25th second at f/11 and ISO 200.&#160;
        I haven't done the full stitch yet (this is a small version) and so I don't know the
        final resolution. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Look for more images in the coming weeks as&#160;I sort through the boatload of data
        I captured.&#160; As a point of reference, I ended up with ~14GB of raw data from
        this trip.&#160; I'm going to run out of disk space!

        I came back from my photo trip and started catching up on email and blogs.&#160; It
        looks like the Google Kirkland open house went well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The bigger news, in my mind, is the technical preview that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/avalon/avnov04ctp/default.aspx">Avalon
        guys shipped</a>.&#160; I'm going to have to download it and play around to see what
        all changed since I left. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was really hoping that they would get something out before the Longhorn beta.&#160;
        I'm sure this was a ton of hard work, but I think that it proves that decoupling Avalon
        and Longhorn was really the right decision.&#160; It will allow the Avalon guys to
        go full steam ahead. 
    </p>
    <p>
        BTW, <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn's blog</a> is a good place to start

    <p>
        I've been super busy at work for the last few weeks.&#160; We've been iterating on
        our stuff and have come up with some cool plans.&#160; Hopefully we can turn those
        into reality and ship them.&#160; I wish I could say more but I really can't.&#160;
        I think that one of the reasons that Google is so reluctant to speak publicly about
        what they are doing is partly to surprise the competition and partly so that we have
        the freedom to try stuff without committing to deliver it.&#160; There may be some
        stuff that never sees the light of day, but it is better than announcing it and then
        it never seeing the light of day.&#160; I think that this probably makes it easier
        to pull the plug on projects that just aren't converging.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides work, some other things are going on that I think are pretty exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I've been helping to port <a href="http://enblend.sourceforge.net">enblend</a> to
        build and run natively under Windows.&#160; Enblend is a cool tool to help in the
        blending stage of making digital panoramas.&#160; My (limited) understanding of the
        mechanics is that it converts the images into the frequency domain to come up with
        an optimal blending mask.&#160; Sometime soon I'd like to start delving into the hard
        parts (Math) and get a better understanding of what is going on.&#160; Andrew (the
        guy who wrote enblend) just released version 2.1 out into the wild.&#160; Let us know
        if you have any problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, I'm going to be missing the Google open house (a rockin' party scheduled for
        Thursday night) so that I can take a trip down to Page, Arizona to shoot slot canyons
        and other various rock formations.&#160; I'm going to be doing a lot of panorama and
        digital mosaic work so look for some cool images soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        One interesting photography note: I've had one of my large pano's printed up pretty
        large -- about 40" x 25" (100cm x 64cm, for those of you of the metric persuasion)
        and have it framed and hanging outside my office.&#160; Even at that large size, the
        photo is tack sharp.&#160; It is really a lot of fun to make images that large.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh yeah, and Halo 2.

        <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2004/10/googles-kirkland-office.html">It's true</a> --
        Google is opening a development office in Kirkland.&#160; In fact, we are moving tonight
        into our new offices.&#160; So far there has been a small group of us working in some
        temporary offices.&#160; It is going to be nice to move into a more permanent space
        where we can actually talk about work in the hallways! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Other nice things about moving: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Someone else is going to get and stock the drink fridge.&#160; We've been doing it
            so far by assigning people to make Costco runs. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We'll have an espresso machine so we can all practice our barista skills. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Conference rooms we can use any time we want. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We can hang our own art on the walls. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Faster connection to the internet and to Mountain View.

        <li>
            <s>Google colored bean bags everywhere.</s> Apparently the company that makes the
            google beanbags isn't making them any more. I didn't ask as I assume this is a long
            and complicated story.&#160; Don't worry -- we'll have foosball instead. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Lots and lots of whiteboards. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Stay tuned for more details!&#160; We are planning an open house&#160;party so that
        Seattle knows we are here.&#160; I don't think we can <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/26.html#a8523">invite
        thousands of people</a> like Scoble is suggesting -- they just wouldn't fit.&#160;
        Unfortunately I won't be around for the party because I'm going to be out of town

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00218.html">Chicago Marathon</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Tue, Oct 12, 2004</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        I spent the last weekend in Chicago visiting my parents and my sister's family and
        her three adorable kids.&#160; (Hi Harper, Ellie and Tate!)
    </p>
    <p>
        We combined this trip with my wife&#160;Rachel's first marathon!&#160; We took the
        train downtown early on Sunday morning and got there in plenty of time for the start.&#160;
        It was a complete mob scene.&#160; There were 40,000 people signed up to run the marathon.&#160;
        It took Rachel 15 minutes or so to actually get to the start line.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I cut across the course and was able to see her run by at the halfway mark.&#160;
        I then took my time walking to the finish line so that I could try to catch a glimpse
        of her on the home stretch.&#160; I missed her there but was able to meet up with
        her in the park outside the finish.&#160; Right after she finished she collapsed on
        me and said that it was the hardest thing she ever did and also the best.&#160; That
        is something coming from someone who finished a medical internship.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm so proud of her running it!&#160; Now all she has to do is let her feet heal.&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        Interesting stuff:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Everyone is timed with what is called a "champion chip."&#160; This is a little device
            that you tie on to your shoe that marks when you step on checkpoints along the course.&#160;
            They had 10 of these checkpoints total.&#160; I'm not sure what technology they use,
            but it seems to work pretty well.&#160; There would be no way to get an accurate time
            for 40k people without something like this.</li>
        <li>
            Right after Rachel finished someone in front of her called for a medic.&#160; A woman
            and her father had apparently just finished together when he collapsed on the ground.&#160;
            He was still talking but obviously dizzy and confused.&#160; Rachel introduced herself
            as a doctor and volunteered to help.&#160;&#160;She checked his pulse on his wrist
            and in his neck.&#160; If you have a pulse in your wrist, your blood pressure is at
            least 90.&#160; If it is in your neck it is at least 60.&#160; Since the man had a
            pulse in his neck but not in his wrist he had a blood pressure under 90.&#160; She
            sat with them until the medics arrived and he was wheeled away.&#160; We both hope
            everything is okay!</li>
        <li>
            There is a company that tries to take pictures of everyone.&#160; Apparently they
            just shoot away and try to sort it all out later.&#160; Last night when we checked
            the site they had finished going through 22% of the photos they had taken and had
            three pictures of Rachel online.&#160; I can't imagine dealing with that many pictures!&#160;
            I'm wondering if they have some sort&#160;of OCR system to read the bib numbers off
            the runners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I took some pictures but I haven't had a chance to sort through them yet.&#160; Hopefully
        I can put one or two up in the next couple of days.

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00217.html">Adobe DNG image format</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Mon, Sep 27, 2004</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Adobe announced today a new image format for storing raw camera data.&#160; Dubbed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dng/main.html">DNG</a>&#160;(for
        Digital Negative) this format is meant to be a common interchange for the fast proliferating
        collection of proprietary raw image formats.&#160; By some estimates there are over
        60 different raw image formats out there.&#160; Because of this, there are really
        only a couple of software vendors that can afford to get into the raw image processing
        game.&#160; It appears that Adobe hopes to level this playing field with this new
        specification. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand the significance of this, it is important that you understand how raw
        image formats work and why they are different.&#160; When most modern cameras (not
        using the <a href="http://www.foveon.com/X3_tech.html">Foveon</a> sensor) advertise
        take a picture, they have a grid of sensors.&#160; These sensors only measure intensity
        but not color.&#160; To capture color data, a color filter (called a Bayer filter)
        is placed over the sensor so that each little sensor only sees one color (typically
        Red, Green and Blue).&#160; That means that the camera only knows one color value
        at each pixel.&#160; This raw data is then processed using a set of complex algorithms
        to produce an image that has all the color information for each pixel.&#160; For each
        pixel in the raw data, these algorithms reconstruct the missing color data by looking
        at the surrounding pixels and <em>guessing</em>.&#160; Because of this guessing, there
        are multiple ways to process this raw data -- and there is the possibility that these
        algorithms and guessing will get better in the future.&#160; Because of this, all
        serious cameras offer a raw mode where the raw (or close to it) sensor data is saved
        in a special format and the complex demosaicing algorithms can be done later on a
        computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, raw images are fundamentally different from regular images in that they store
        raw sensor data before it has been processed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The rub comes with the fact that each camera manufacturer has a proprietary raw format
        (or two or three) and some generally crappy software for dealing with it.&#160; Companies
        like Adobe (with the Adobe Camera Raw plugin for photoshop) and Capture One have been
        waging a guerilla war to create products to read all of these formats.&#160; If Adobe
        can succeed in getting camera manufacturers to implement this format in their cameras,
        life for many photographers could become much much easier.&#160; But this isn't a
        sure thing.&#160; Camera manufacturers are very aware of the business benefits of
        lock in.&#160; They do it with lens mounts and with their software suites.&#160; Canon
        or Nikon may see their proprietary formats as an advantage in the marketplace.&#160;
        Nikon even charges for the software to convert its raw format while Canon and most
        other manufacturers provide it for free. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I haven't gotten a read from my buddies in Microsoft imaging, but I'm hoping that
        DNG is a huge success.&#160; Assuming that Adobe doesn't try to assert its own proprietary
        control over the format (Postscript anyone?) it may just let the camera manufacturers
        concentrate on making cameras and leave the software development up to a third party
        marketplace. 
    </p>
    <p>
        [update: RichB points out that there is also an open source utility for dealing with
        raw camera data called <a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/">DCRaw</a> and
        built by Dave Coffin. Apparently Photoshop (and Capture One?) build on some of Dave's
        work.]

        <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> and I hung out tonight and went
        to dinner together.&#160; We started out from my house in Montlake and walked through
        the university to Aladdin Gyro's up north of 45th on the Ave.&#160; We were going
        to go to Thai Tom but the line was too long. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We talked about Google, Microsoft and the industry as a whole.&#160; Tip jars, Bush
        and how I should never expect to get social security (I already knew this).&#160;

        Since everyone wanted to see me wearing my Noogler hat, I had him snap a quick picture
        with my new Canon 20D.&#160; I also grabbed a picture of him. We are both looking
        a little worse for wear from the long walk up there and back.

        One correction:&#160; I wasn't <em>the</em> lead developer on Avalon, but rather one

        They call new Google employees Nooglers.&#160; That was what I was last week when
        I was down in Mountain View.&#160; It was a pretty exciting week.&#160; I went to
        some training classes and got my computers set up and such.&#160; I spent quite a
        bit of time working and hanging out with other Googlers.&#160; Everyone was super

        I met with HR yesterday afternoon to turn in my batch and my corporate AmEx card.&#160;
        It felt like a cheesy cop show:&#160; "Gimme your badge and your gun, Mahoney -- you're
        suspended!"&#160; Right after that I went back to my building and had a buddy sign
        me in as a visitor so that we could all hang out and play some xbox.&#160; It&#160;was
        hard to let go and not get involved in the discussions going on in the hallways.&#160;
        The day before a large group of us went out for my goodbye lunch.&#160; It felt a
        little bit like a funeral in its finality.&#160;

    <p>
        First off, I'd like to say that everyone has been really good about my leaving --
        both inside and outside of the company.&#160; I think that most everyone understands

        Tomorrow, friday, is my last day at Microsoft.&#160; I've been there for a little
        over 7 years, plus 2 internships.&#160; I've helped (in large or small part) ship
        Microsoft Team Manager, IE4, IE5, IE5.5, IE6, Windows NT 4, Windows 98, Windows 98SE,
        Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2k3 and Windows XP SP2.&#160; I've been
        working with a great group of people on Avalon and Longhorn for the past couple of
        years.&#160; It is really hard to say goodbye to so many friends and such a great
        group.&#160; But I feel that it is time to move on to new challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going to be going to go work for Google.&#160; It looks like I'll be staying in
        the Seattle area for now.&#160; Don't ask me what I'll be doing because I honestly
        don't know.&#160; I'm going to be working with a good group of guys that I've worked
        with before.&#160; I trust that they are working on interesting technology.&#160;
        Hopefully we'll be able to make a splash at some point.&#160; Chances are that I won't
        be able to talk about it here for quite a while though.
    </p>
    <p>
        The decision to leave Microsoft has been a very difficult one.&#160; I still believe
        in the Avalon vision and plan.&#160; I'm more excited than ever about the technology.&#160;
        Even though I knew that I was going to leave a couple of weeks ago, I meant everything
        that I've posted and said.&#160; You can be sure that my excitement over the recent
        changes to the Longhorn and Avalon ship plans <em>aren't</em> the company line.&#160;
        If I disagreed I would have said so.&#160; What are they going to do, fire me?&#160;
        In some ways I feel like I've made my impact on the Avalon project.&#160; I've been
        there since the start and helped shape what it is today.&#160; There is a lot of work
        to do yet, but the broad strokes are in place.&#160; Now I'm just like most of you
        reading this: I'm going to be a user of the Avalon technology instead of one of the
        guys developing it.&#160; I wish those losers would get off their butts and ship already
        :)
    </p>
    <p>
        It has been an exciting month and a half or so.&#160; I sat down for coffee with a
        coworker who is working for Google sometime in late July.&#160; We chatted and he
        told me about the way that Google works and how much fun he was having there.&#160;
        The thing that really attracted me was the fact that it was just a smaller company
        with smaller groups.&#160; After working on such large projects for so long, I was
        really ready to try something on a smaller scale.&#160; Plus, I've been working for
        MS for my entire professional life and I'm going to have to diversify at some point.&#160;
        Anyway, I got a resume to him and flew down to Mountain View for an interview.&#160;
        Things went well and I accepted&#160;the offer last week.&#160; As a point of reference,
        I didn't find out about the Longhorn schedule shake up until a few weeks after I started
        the whole process.
    </p>
    <p>
        What does this mean for my blog?&#160; Nothing really.&#160; I'm still going to talk
        Avalon -- I just won't have the inside line anymore.&#160; My knowledge will probably
        go stale in the next month or so.&#160; Eventually I hope to talk about Google stuff,
        but I'm going to have to feel out where the lines are.&#160;

      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Everyone is still digesting what exactly is going on with Avalon, WinFS and Longhorn.&#160; <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/08/30.html#a8167">Scoble</a> is
        a great place to start for links to the reaction in general.&#160; ChrisAn also has
        some <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/8ccbbce9-0ec7-408f-9209-6ef233850dbb">Q&amp;A
        on what this means to Avalon</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that I can answer some more questions that people might have.&#160; I'll take
        the Q&amp;A format that ChrisAn used. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. What does this mean for the Avalon graphics architecture as you </strong><a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/18.html"><strong>presented
        it at WinHEC</strong></a><strong>?<br />
        </strong>Actually, things&#160;mostly don't change from an architectural point of
        view.&#160; We will have to make some tweaks and compromises to ensure that Avalon
        runs well on XP and W2K3.&#160; All of these compromises will be because we probably
        won't be able to update&#160;any&#160;system binaries (User32, GDI, etc.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. You said that Avalon <em>had</em> to have Longhorn to work well.&#160;
        Now it is going to run on XP and W2k3.&#160; What gives?</strong> 
        <br />
        There were some very good reasons for us to restrict Avalon to run just on Longhorn.&#160;
        However, when looking at what customers said and our schedule, it made more sense
        to bend on some of those reasons than to force developers to wait for wide adoption
        of Longhorn before being able to write apps.&#160; Here are some areas where we are
        going to have to get creative in making Avalon work on XP and W2k3: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Lack of the LDDM (Longhorn Device Driver Model). </em>Right now the XPDM (XP Driver
            Model), wrt DX, is really built to work well for one app at a time.&#160; It&#160;uses
            first come, first server, winner take all approach to resource allocation.&#160; While
            Avalon runs just fine on the XPDM, it isn't clear that&#160;lots of Avalon apps running
            at the same time will work really well without the LDDM.&#160; There are also concerns
            around the stability of current DX drivers under the XPDM.&#160; These drivers have
            been written with the gaming market in mind.&#160; Using them for every day applications
            may push them to some breaking points.&#160; All sorts of options are being considered
            on how to deal with this.&#160; And for machines that we can't support hardware acceleration
            on, we always have our software rendering layer that we can fall back to.&#160; Early
            on we decided no to rely on hardware being available on every machine.&#160; That
            decision is paying off now. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Inability to really tweak User32. </em>In Longhorn builds we had the ability to
            do "child window redirection".&#160; This is a Win32 interop solution where child
            hWnds get redirected by the system to a bitmap that the Avalon compositor then hosts.&#160;
            This allowed Win32 content to alpha blend and rotate just like any Avalon content.&#160;
            Since we won't be able to change system binaries on older systems, we won't be able
            to do this redirection on XP and W2k3.&#160; We'll have to find a compromise solution
            to hosting legacy content.&#160; You probably won't be able to treat it like regular
            Avalon content.&#160; Eventually we want to be able to support these advanced legacy
            hosting solutions, but it probably won't work on XP and W2k3. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Terminal Services and Remote Desktop. </em>We were planning on remoting Avalon
            at a completely different layer.&#160; It is unclear how we will address this issue
            on platforms other than Longhorn.&#160; The long term plan and architecture still
            encompasses enhanced remoting. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Media decoding system.&#160; </em>A lot of the video hosting relied on components
            being delivered from the media team.&#160; Since we are now perhaps shipping via a
            different mechanism than they are, the level of integration and interdependencies
            are now up in the air.&#160; We are working on figure that out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Desktop Window Manager.&#160; </em>The DWM will still exist and be included as
            part of Longhorn.&#160; There are no plans to make the DWM run on XP and W2k3.&#160;
            The cross process UCE architecture presented at WinHEC remains unchanged for when
            Avalon apps are running under the DWM on Longhorn. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>3. How has the Avalon vision changed?&#160; Is it a less ambitious plan now?<br />
        </strong>The long term Avalon vision hasn't changed.&#160; We still want to enable
        the same hardware accelerated, media rich, easy to develop, network connected&#160;application
        platform that we've been talking about since the 2003 PDC.&#160; The real change here
        is a new pragmatic staged approach to getting it out the door and in the hands of
        developers.&#160; If we've talked about some feature or doodad that has to be compromised
        to make Avalon work under these new constraints, don't worry.&#160; Chances are that
        that feature is still on the list for when we <em>can </em>do it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4. What is your personal opinion on these changes, Joe?<br />
        </strong>Thanks for asking!&#160; Personally I'm really excited by these changes.&#160;
        It is painful to have to sacrifice (at least when running on XP and W2k3 -- they may
        "light up on Longhorn") some of the features that <em>require</em> deep changes to
        the system but the overall result of being able to deliver Avalon to XP and W2k3 outweigh
        that pain dramatically.&#160; Anything we can do to get Avalon out the door on a more
        deterministic schedule and to deliver it to a wider audience of developers seems like
        a good thing to me.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Making hard decisions like this is necessary to get big projects out the door.&#160;
        While it would have been great if we had figured some of this stuff out a year (or
        more) ago, this is better late than never.&#160; $50 billion in the bank (or whatever
        it is these days) is a lot of money but it still doesn't buy you a crystal ball to
        see in to the future.

    <p>
        I've polished up my pano building tool so that it now works with large 16 bit panoramas.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        To recap from <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/06/25.html">last
        episode</a>:&#160; <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm">PTAssembler</a> and <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/pano12ml.htm">PanoTools</a> are <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/digital-panoramas.shtml">really
        cool</a>&#160;but there are some bugs in PanoTools that prevent it from working with
        really large images or 16 bit images.&#160; The first is that PanoTools outputs tiff
        images that use packbits compression.&#160; For some reason Photoshop chokes when
        loading these files.&#160; The second issue is that PanoTools doesn't know how to
        create 16 bit photoshop files with layers as photoshop didn't <em>do</em> 16 bit layers
        when it was written.&#160; I've worked around this with my latest version of PanoTiffToPSD. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It does the following: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Optionally uses libtiff to reencode a set of tiff&#160;images with no compression.&#160;
            To save disk space, you can choose to overwrite the original images or do the conversion
            and leave the original images alone.&#160; The converted version will be deleted after
            being used by photoshop. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Loads up&#160;each of the tiff files and drives Photoshop (via IDispatch COM interfaces
            for you dorks out there) to load up each file and move it to a layer in a new image. 
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This morning I spend a couple of hours hanging out in the Redmond courthouse to contest
        a speeding ticket.&#160; I didn't get my act together enough to file for discovery
        so I couldn't put together a real defense.&#160; There appear to be two easy ways
        to beat a ticket around here.&#160; First the infraction might not have been filed
        on time.&#160; Second, your trail might not be speedy enough -- two months after the
        infraction, I think.&#160; Neither of these applied to me so I ended up getting a
        deferred finding (a sort of probation). 
    </p>
    <p>
        While I probably could have done this via mail, it was enlightening to watch how things
        work.&#160; First, your trial doesn't get scheduled really.&#160; You are grouped
        with all of the other cases to be covered that morning.&#160; You sit there from the
        beginning of the session until your name comes up.&#160; The judge presiding this
        morning worked it such that the actual lawyers got to go first and the rest of us
        schmoes representing ourselves go after that.&#160; It was interesting to see how
        much time it really took the lawyers to beat a case.&#160; It mostly was about finding
        a loophole and arguing it.&#160; The judge has some discretion as to how to interpret
        things but most of it is cut and dried.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The thing that really surprised me was that by the time my case came up there were
        no lawyers in the room.&#160; This included the prosecutor.&#160; I think it really
        sucks that you can be tried for an infraction without a prosecuting attorney even
        present.&#160; To me it is a slap in the face that the state wants to extort money
        out of me (via the traffic ticket) without even bothering to have somebody there to
        personally do the extorting.&#160; At least the mafia comes and collects in person.&#160;
        Apparently this has been fought over and gone to the Supreme Bourt (at least that
        is what the judge said)&#160;but I don't have the time to really dig in to it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, I would urge everyone to contest a ticket just once to see how it all
        works.&#160; Or just show up in Redmond courthouse courtroom two any morning and sit
        and watch.

        A couple of buddies of mine (Avi and Ken) both have <a href="http://www.lomography.com/about/">Lomo
        cameras</a> that they shoot with.&#160; For the uninitiated, these are super low tech
        cameras that are mass produced in Russia.&#160; There is no autofocus but instead
        a choice of 4 (count 'em -- four) focus settings.&#160; These cameras are so simple
        and bulletproof, that using them is more of a philosophy than a tool.&#160; The whole
        idea is to experiment and play.&#160; On top of that, the lens isn't sharp corner
        to corner and it has quite a bit if vignetting.&#160; That's okay -- it adds to the
        Lomo look.&#160; If I still shot film, I would pick one of these up right away.&#160;
        I may pick one up anyway.&#160; In essence, these cameras are the anti-digital camera. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you aren't willing to go that far, there is the <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/">lensbaby</a>.&#160;
        I have one of these on order.&#160; This is a super simple lens for you SLR.&#160;
        It is a single lens attached to some flexible tubing.&#160; You focus by using your
        fingertips to move the lens in and out.&#160; You can also tilt the focus plane.&#160;
        This lens also has quite a bit of blur and vignetting.&#160; And it works on digital
        SLRs?&#160; This thing is so old school that you have to manually take it apart to
        change the aperture.&#160; Sure, you could get the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 lens cheaper
        -- and it has autofocus and an adjustable apature.&#160; But there is something cool
        about the look and feel of the images form this lens.&#160; Check out some of the
        photos <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/pages/gall_strong.php">here</a>.&#160; (I

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00194.html">How the TSA tried to kill me</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Thu, Jul 8, 2004</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        I recently went to New Zealand.&#160; Since it is an outdoorsy type of place I put
        my camelback water bladder/backpack in my big duffle bag and had a great time.&#160;
        Since I'm a responsible hiker, I have a standard emergency kit in my backpack that
        contains things like a compass, foil space blanket, ace bandage, banana powerbars
        (these are so gross I'll only eat them in an emergency), etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Cut to me&#160;going on a hike last Monday and grab my trusty back with the kit already
        put together.&#160; I wanted to put something in my emergency pack and noticed a slip
        of paper from the TSA informing me that they had confiscated my pack of 25 windproof
        matches.&#160; If I had a scanner I would post an image of&#160;the notice.&#160;
        The rule apparently is that knives must go in your checked baggage and matches must
        be in your carryon baggage.&#160; Don't ask me to explain this.&#160; Also don't ask
        me to explain why I can't use my PocketPC to read books during takeoff and landing.&#160;
        These things cannot be explained. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, imagine that I had gotten lost in the mountains last Monday and it started to
        get cold.&#160; Normal people would have dispaired and rolled over and died.&#160;
        But not me!&#160; I was a boy scout and was prepared ("Be prepared, its the motto
        of the Boy Scouts!").&#160; I'd reach in to my emergency kit to get my matches to
        start a fire.&#160; Instead of finding life saving matches I would instead find a
        very official looking notice from the TSA letting me know that I'm screwed.

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00192.html">Driving Photoshop from C#</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Fri, Jun 25, 2004</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        <strong>Update: </strong>8/29/04 -- There is an updated version of this tool described <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/08/28.html#a207">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've been a regular reader, you know that I've been <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/25.html#a188">having
        a blast</a> <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/06/14.html#a189">playing </a>with
        making digital panoramas.&#160; The problem that I've been hitting is twofold: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            When I want to use <a href="http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mihal/enblend/">enblend</a> to
            do the blending, I don't get the component layers in photoshop.&#160; I get a flat
            blended tiff file that usually looks great.&#160; However, if I want to tweak it I
            have to manually find the tiff file and&#160;import that to a layer so that I can
            paint the original over the endblended result. 
        </li>
        <li>
            PanoTools can work with 16bit files just fine but it doesn't know how to create a
            Photoshop PSD file.&#160; (16 bit layers were only added in Photoshop CS. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Both of these require the fairly manual process of loading up a bunch of tif files
        and copying them in to one composite file with masks. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Being a dork, I wrote a program to automate this from the outside.&#160; This is a
        command line utility that drives photoshop from the outside.&#160; It would be cool
        if this were a plugin that would go in the "Automate" menu but I didn't have time
        to figure that out. It just grabs a bunch of files, opens them up one by one and puts
        them in to a new PS&#160;file.&#160; &#160;This works well with the individual .tif
        files that PanoTools creates.&#160; If you have feature suggestions let me know and
        I'll see what I can do. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, here is the <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/PanoTiffToPSD/PanoTiffToPSD-exe-1.0.zip">binary</a>, <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/PanoTiffToPSD/PanoTiffToPSD-src-1.0.zip">source</a> and <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/PanoTiffToPSD/License.txt">license</a>.&#160;
        Please be aware that this requires the version 1.1 .Net runtime.&#160; You can get
        this from <a href="http://www.windowsupdate.com">windows update</a> if you don't already.&#160; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/technologyinfo/howtoget/default.aspx">Here</a> is
        more info on getting the runtime. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Interesting notes on programming to Photoshop: 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two ways to automate photoshop (that I've found).&#160; The first is using
        "Actions".&#160; This is the built in way to record a bunch of steps and replay them.&#160;
        There is a bunch of UI for this and it is good for simple things.&#160; Actions are
        to limiting for this problem&#160;as anything that iterates over multiple files or
        has "if" statements is super hard to do with Actions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The second way to program is via a set of COM interfaces.&#160; Adobe installs a type
        library that provides some nice object model to do quite a few things.&#160; My understanding
        is that this is exposed via a built in javascript engine and via applescript on Macs.&#160;
        Since COM is language neutral, you can drive it (for example) via the scripting host
        (JavaScript, VBScript), &#160;<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">perl</a>,
        VB or C#.&#160; I choose to use C#. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The programmable interface has some pretty glaring holes in its support.&#160; For
        example, you can't do anything with the tools such as the magic wand.&#160; There
        is also no easy programmatic access to creation of layer masks.&#160; You can get
        around this by installing a plugin called the "ScriptListener."&#160; This essentially
        creates funky unreadable code that (I'm thinking) uses the same hooks as the Actions
        code.&#160; On windows this is written out as VB or JavaScript.&#160; Here is an example
        from "c:\ScriptingListenerJS.log" to create a layer mask on the current layer. 
    </p>
    <pre>// =======================================================
var id375 = charIDToTypeID( "Mk  " );
    var desc84 = new ActionDescriptor();
    var id376 = charIDToTypeID( "Nw  " );
    var id377 = charIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
    desc84.putClass( id376, id377 );
    var id378 = charIDToTypeID( "At  " );
        var ref66 = new ActionReference();
        var id379 = charIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
        var id380 = charIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
        var id381 = charIDToTypeID( "Msk " );
        ref66.putEnumerated( id379, id380, id381 );
    desc84.putReference( id378, ref66 );
    var id382 = charIDToTypeID( "Usng" );
    var id383 = charIDToTypeID( "UsrM" );
    var id384 = charIDToTypeID( "RvlA" );
    desc84.putEnumerated( id382, id383, id384 );
executeAction( id375, desc84, DialogModes.NO );</pre>
    <p>
        As you can see, this isn't the easiest code to read. The solution is to wrap it in
        functions that you can call at will. Here is how I created a C# function out of this: 
    </p>
    <pre>void CreateLayerMask()
{
    int id375 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Mk  " );
    PS.ActionDescriptor desc84 = new PS.ActionDescriptor();
    int id376 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Nw  " );
    int id377 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
    desc84.PutClass( id376, id377 );
    int id378 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "At  " );
    PS.ActionReference ref66 = new PS.ActionReference();
    int id379 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
    int id380 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Chnl" );
    int id381 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Msk " );
    ref66.PutEnumerated( id379, id380, id381 );
    desc84.PutReference( id378, ref66 );
    int id382 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "Usng" );
    int id383 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "UsrM" );
    int id384 = app.CharIDToTypeID( "RvlA" );
    desc84.PutEnumerated( id382, id383, id384 );
    app.ExecuteAction( id375, desc84, PS.PsDialogModes.psDisplayNoDialogs );
}</pre>
    <p>
        This is a little bit of a pain but at least you can get stuff done.&#160; It would
        be cool if we could build a library of these things.&#160; If anyone else is interested
        in driving photoshop let me know and I'll help bring this stuff together.

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00191.html"> Yet More on the Rich Client</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Mon, Jun 21, 2004</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.articulatebabble.org/archives/2004/06/20T021013.php">Vince has
        responded</a> to my "<a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/06/18.html#a190">Defending
        the Rich Client</a>" post. 
    </p>
    <p>
        He works on writing games for <a href="http://www.midway.com/">Midway</a> and has
        a unique perspective.&#160; He says that the type of games that he writes are the
        ultimate rich client.&#160; To a certain degree I agree, but I'd like to dodge some
        of that as this is a market where Avalon definately isn't targeted. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, Vince does talk about internal authoring tools for games such as level editors
        and he has some concerns with how plausible it would be for someone to start taking
        advantage of the CLR and Avalon.&#160; I'm not an interop expert, but here are some
        thoughts:&#160; 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Add-ins for other packages.&#160; If those packages are DLL based, you can always
            use MC++ to write add-ins.&#160; With both WinForms (I think) and Avalon, you should
            be able to write UI that can be hosted via hwnds.&#160; If the package is COM based,
            you can either use MC++ or CLR COM interop support.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Writing a new tool. You shouldn't have to start from scratch.&#160; You can host windows
            that are written in unmanaged code in both WinForms and Avalon.&#160; Beyond this,
            you can manage internal intefaces via P/Invoke, COM interop or MC++ (if you aren't
            happy with the current managed C++ implementation, all I can say is that the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/slippman/archive/2004/05/28/143886.aspx">team
            has heard you</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/whidbey/">changes</a> are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hsutter/">in
            the works</a>). 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The next question: Is it worth it?&#160; We definately hope so, but there is nothing
        stopping you from continuing to use the technologies that you are currently using.&#160;
        Managed code and garbage collection aren't the solution to every problem.&#160; There
        are certainly places where it does make sense to drop down in to unmanaged code, just
        like there are places where it make sense to drop down in to assembly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, if you do decide to jump, will it do everything that you want?&#160; Vince gives
        an example where he can't get a specific behavior out of WinForms without dropping
        down and P/Invoking.&#160; I'm not sure what is going on here, but the reality is
        that there are going to be things that we don't wrap or don't think of.&#160; That
        is just the challenge of writing a platform -- we try to expose as much functionality
        as possible in as easy to program a way as possible while leaving as much room for
        extensibility as possible.&#160; This is a complicated equation and we are sure to
        miss stuff.&#160; To complicate things, when we move forward with something that is
        more than just evolutionary (WinForms and Avalon, for example) there are going to
        be regressions in functionality.&#160; We may have decided to change the equation
        from one framework to another.&#160; All I can really say is that we try our best
        and please let us know if there is something we missed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, Vince looks at my 3 reasons to write rich client apps: presentation, local storage
        and network connectivity.&#160; How important these are to different developers and
        users depends on specific circumstances.&#160; While local storage may not be that
        big a deal for networking, it would be huge for an online image gallery application
        with a smart client interface (it looks like the guys at <a href="http://www.ngallery.org">nGallery</a> are
        eventually headed in this direction).&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        One area where the web model has been ahead of the traditional Windows APIs is the
        ease of connecting to the network.&#160; But it was the case where there were things
        you could do with Win32 (raw network access) that you can't do with a typical browser
        and there are things that you can do with the browser (talk http to load and display
        an image asynchronously) that are super hard in Win32.&#160; Making the smart client
        better is all about removing these "either-or" choices and giving you the best of
        both worlds. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, Steve rails on the fact that it looks like MSBuild isn't going to support
        VC++ out of the box.&#160; I have no clue what is going on here but stay tuned to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/akipman/">AKipman's
        blog</a> for news. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I really think that this is a healty debate and I thank Joel for getting
        it started.&#160; Hopefully this gives everyone a little insight in to why we are
        doing what we are doing in Avalon and Longhorn.

        in</a> on the action too. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Go ahead and read them if you haven't already and then come back. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is my summary so that Jon, Joel and everyone else can make sure that I'm reading
        them right. First, Jon is asking why anyone (and the "enterprise" specifically) would
        want to write a rich client (probably for any platform) above and beyond a web application.
        Joel takes this and runs with it -- saying essentially that the rich client is dead
        and that the Windows API is dying with a whimper. He also says that there are two
        camps of developers inside of Windows: those that want to keep on the same track and
        those who are for all the new technologies. 
    </p>
    <h4>IE history 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Being on the Windows team, and Avalon specifically, my job is to help write a product
        that is compelling enough to overcome the very valid concerns that these guys have.
        I started out on the IE team (now you know where at least a little bit of the IE team
        went, Joel) back in 1997 -- toward the tail end of IE4 development. I firmly believe
        that we had the better product starting with IE4 and we really turned up the heat
        with IE5. IE was, in a lot of ways, a rear guard action against Netscape. Netscape
        was trying to replace the Windows API with a cross platform "Netscape" API. 
    </p>
    <p>
        IE was, buy many metrics, very successful. First, we gained significant adoption.
        I personally think that this was mostly due to a superior product. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, we also, by making the browser market a 2 horse race, drove baseline interoperability
        in the web space. Where would the world be without IE? Do you think that we would
        have an interoperable browser space now? Based on pure psychic reasoning, my guess
        is that without the healthy competition from MS, Netscape would have owned the client
        space completely. At this point I don't think that <i>anyone</i> owns the web client
        platform. Despite IE's market share, the network addressable platform pieces that
        anyone uses are largely restricted to the W3C blessed parts. So, taking a look at
        the IE4 and IE5 timeframe, in some ways you can thank Microsoft for enabling a mostly
        standards based web by making the browser a two horse race. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Where IE wasn't successful was in bringing the Web model in as a fundamental part
        of the Windows API. Sure, you had the reusable browser control and the Trident (mshtml.dll)
        engine. But you were either writing a web-like application (HTAs included) or you
        were writing a Win32 application. There were certain things that were easy to do with
        traditional Win32 that you couldn't do with IE and things that you could do easily
        with IE that you couldn't do with Win32. 
    </p>
    <h4>The best of windows and the best of the web 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Avalon, and Longhorn in general, is our attempt to reenergize the rich client at Microsoft.
        Is it, as Joel says, too late? I don't think so. I think that the combination of features
        we are putting together will be compelling enough to start turning the tide. Are we
        ever going to see a world where the web is history and all development is focused
        on writing Longhorn applications? Of course not. Longhorn is a long term investment
        to start laying the ground work for a rich client that takes advantage of the web
        in a way that we have never been able to before. This is what we mean when we say
        that we want to make Avalon the best of Windows and the best of the Web. We want to
        take some of the advantages of the web and build them in to the windows API. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do people write web based client/server apps over writing rich client apps for
        Windows? 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Frictionless deployment story 
        </li>
        <li>
            Cross platform interoperability 
        </li>
        <li>
            More fun to code -- you can set up your own API system and abstract HTML to a large
            extent 
        </li>
        <li>
            Built in network/server awareness 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You put all of these together and you have a pretty darn compelling story for many
        scenarios. How can the Windows client compete with this? The key is to take the good
        things of the web that we can (1, 3 and 4) and combine that with all of the goodness
        from having stuff run on the client. Don't get me wrong -- I still believe in the
        web as a way to interoperate and exchange content and as a lowest common denominator
        for UI interaction. But we can do so much better than HTML with the horsepower that
        is sitting on our desk when it makes sense to do so. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, Joel says that he can "install" GMail by hitting Ctrl-D, gmail, Ctrl-Enter.
        My understanding (and I haven't had time to really play with GMail yet) is that Google
        has written browser specific code to enhance the user experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With Avalon you should be able to implement a GMail like application that takes advantage
        of the rich client in some very significant ways: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Rich user experience</b>.&#160; No page refreshes on simple actions.&#160; Smooth
            animation and graphical composition.&#160; The ability to do rich real time data visualization. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Local Storage</b>. Cache the mail data locally for faster access and more integration
            with other desktop services.&#160; You could also support reading and responding to
            mail while offline. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Easy network connectivity</b>.&#160; Using web services, the ability to use widely
            interoperable protocols to talk with a server. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Will this be possible in Longhorn? YES. This is the direction that we want to go and
        what I mean when I say "network connected rich client applications." We aren't replacing
        the web or the web paradigm. We are instead providing the platform so that it is easy
        -- and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">worthwhile</i> -- for developers to
        differentiate when their applications are running on Windows. 
    </p>
    <h4>But what about the enterprise? 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Now, to get to some specific points brought up in the articles. Jon brings up some
        good points around the enterprise space. I can only say that we are working hard to
        build a package of features on the client that will either make enterprise developers
        willing to standardize on Longhorn or take the extra cost to provide a rich client
        solution in addition to a web based solution. There are some applications where this
        will never make sense. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there are a set of applications that are currently being implemented on against
        today's web clients that could be vastly improved by rich client capabilities. I can
        definitely see a need for a rich expense reporting application with a good offline
        mode and rich display and reporting. Anything that involves charting or graphing can
        also be enhanced by using some rich client technologies. I use Outlook every day to
        do email. There is a web solution for Exchange called "Outlook Web Access" (OWA) that
        uses DHTML and all of the other web goodies to provide as good an experience as possible
        through the web client. While I think that OWA is great and I'm a huge fan of what
        those guys are doing, I'd still much rather use the real Outlook. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With Avalon we are hoping to make it vastly easier to write rich data connected applications
        like Outlook. However, we don't want stop there. We also want developers to be able
        to get the best of the web. These applications can run in the browser for the browser
        experience or can be "one click" installed and run on the desktop.&#160; Even when
        they are "installed" they can be managed from the server and be kept up to date as
        easily as copying a new version on to the server. Think of how many enterprise LOB
        apps could benefit from that? Expense reporting (with offline mode), "Digital Dashboard"
        data aggregation and visualization, integrated content creation, new network connected
        collaboration applications and more.&#160; 
    </p>
    <h4>Backward compatibility 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Now, talking to some of Joel's points: He says that we have fundamentally changed
        our view of backward compatibility. I totally disagree. As one Slashdot poster <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=111332&amp;cid=9446923">put
        it</a>: "Joel confuses binary compatibility with API compatibility." From the end
        users point of view we are still completely committed to making apps that run on Windows
        continue to run on Windows. At the PDC, Jim Allchin showed off <s>Lotus 123</s> Visicalc
        running on Longhorn. The developer experience, however, will have a gap -- it is necessary
        as part of the transition to managed code. He states that VB.Net not being source
        compatible with VB6 is a first. I would argue that the switch from 16 bit to 32 bit
        is very similar to the switch from unmanaged code to managed code. Old apps will continue
        to run and new apps are written to the new technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In Avalon we are working very hard to provide rich ways for application developers
        to tie their old code in with new code that takes advantage of our new technologies.
        You can host a Win32 hwnd -- WinForms based or not -- in with Avalon content. You
        can also host Avalon content in a Win32 hwnd. You can nest these completely. While
        it is true that you have to write new code to get the new features -- and that the
        new code is part of a completely new framework -- we don't want to force application
        developers to rewrite everything to start using our stuff. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Above and beyond what Avalon has been doing, the C++ team has heard what the community
        has been saying and is doing some great work in Whidbey to make the managed version
        of C++ better than ever.&#160; It will be the best solution for those who have the
        C++ code and skills and want to start taking advantage of the the CLR. 
    </p>
    <h4>What's a $300B (market cap) company to do? 
    </h4>
    <p>
        The real question is: What are we to do? Without arguing about the fine points, we
        are stuck with a choice. We can either continue adding doodad on top of doodad to
        Win32 (and maintain backward compat from an API and binary perspective) or we can
        try and make a fresh start with WinFX and set ourselves up for the future. Look at
        the timelines: Windows 1.0 with the start of Win16 came out in 1985. Windows 95, with
        the mainstream advent of Win32 came out in 1995. It is now 2004. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now is the time for Microsoft to either watch the Windows rich client sail in to the
        sunset or to do its best to reinvigorate it. The only way to make this happen is to
        go "all-in" and think big. We want to empower developers by making a much richer,
        network connected and modern API for programming on windows. WinFX is all about taking
        what we've learned over the last 20 years and creating a solid platform for the next
        20 years. We will provide the right API, backward compat for old applications and
        a great bridge between the two for developers. If we really want developers to write
        code that only runs on windows, we have to provide features and enticements that they
        can't get anywhere else. While I don't think that it is too late, I do think that
        we have our work cut out for us.

    <p>
        I appreciate the attention and I've been trying to keep up with all of the comments.&#160;
        Here are some notes and responses: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First off, I can't answer every question.&#160; I have no desire to get in to a flame
            war over specific details or comparisons. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232376">Avalon's
            relationship to Direct3D</a>:&#160; I tried to make this clear in the slides, but
            it is worth repeating.&#160; We are building a managed presentation and UI layer on
            top of Direct3D.&#160; While we will be exposing a 3D API, it is meant to round out
            the UI story and integrate well with our 2D API.&#160; If you are doing super complex
            3D stuff (FPS games), or want access to the latest and greatest Direct3D features,
            Direct3D is the way to go.&#160; If you want to mix a little 3D in with your 2D, Avalon's
            3D APIs will let you do that in a painless way. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232430">Do
            we really need the eye candy?</a>: This has been a popular topic ever since we started
            planning and talking about Avalon.&#160; I'm planning on posting something on this
            later to start the discussion.&#160; My short take: I think that providing more capability
            in the platform is a good thing that will make Windows a more attractive place to
            write applications.&#160; I think that it will also allow our stock user experience
            (Aero and the shell team) and application developers to push the limits and interact
            with users in fundamentally better ways.&#160; However, with power comes responsibility.&#160;
            We are working on a set of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/ux/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaero/html/samplerintro.asp">guidelines</a> (these
            are the Aero user interface guidelines) to help application authors use this stuff
            in a consistent way. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232485">The
            3D bar graph demo is useless</a>: I admit, this <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/06.html#a182">example</a> is
            useless as is.&#160; In a <em>real</em> application there will be a lot more UI about
            picking what data you want to look at and how you want to look at it.&#160; The position
            and view of the 3D graph would probably be controlled by the mouse so that you can
            rotate things around to see hidden data.&#160; There would probably be different types
            of graphs that you would switch between.&#160; However, this was meant as a demo application
            that we threw together in a couple of days.&#160; While the application is a demo,
            the platform that it is running on is real.&#160; There should be nothing stopping
            someone from building a more industrial strength really usable version of this.

        <li>
            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232540">We
            are behind the ball on 64 bit</a>:&#160; While Windows had been compiling and shipping
            (well, in beta to be clear) on 64 bit for quite a while (we handed out ia64 and x64
            versions of Longhorn at WinHEC and via MSDN) the real call to action here was to IHVs.&#160;
            Remember this&#160;was the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference.&#160; IHVs have
            limited resources wrt writing drivers and we want to encourage them to write and maintain
            64 bit drivers.&#160; This was one of the big pushes for the conference as a whole.&#160;
            We don't want 64 bit uptake to be slowed down by lack of driver support.

            <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=108587&amp;cid=9232633">The
            longhorn requirements are crazy</a>: I don't know where the requirements listed here
            came from, but I haven't seen that list.&#160; Obviously we won't see that on a laptop!&#160;
            There are a couple of things to note here.&#160; 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First, we will run in software and on lower end machines.&#160; Things may run slower,
                    but it will run.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second, we are going to offer multiple experiences based on hardware capabilities
                    and user preferences.&#160; This ranges from a classic view, to Aero to Aero Glass.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third, the current minimum requirement for Aero Glass is a DX9 class card with 64MB
                    of video memory.&#160; More video memory will be required for higher resolutions or
                    multiple monitors.&#160; We also require the GPU to support PS 2.0 and have a LDDM
                    (Longhorn Device Driver Model) driver. 
                </li>

                    Fourth, as for processor requirements, most of the time when we have, in the past,
                    required a certain speed processor it has been because that speed has been an indicator
                    of the rest of the components in the machine (bus speed, hard driver speed, memory
                    speed, processor instruction support, etc.)&#160; The idea has been to use that one
                    number&#160;as a <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">heuristic </span>for
                    the "generation" of the machine.&#160; Hell, I've run Win2k3 server on a 400MHz celeron.&#160;

                    Lastly, we <em>are</em> really concerned about battery life and are working hard to
                    come up with a scalable user experience for times when battery life is more important
                    than running the GPU at full throttle.&#160; I believe that there are a bunch of slides
                    in Kerry's talk on that.

            where the guy who posted this to OSNews.com got it.&#160; It really touched off a
            flamewar there which basically comes down to your definition of innovation.&#160;
            Leaving that aside...&#160; I think that Avalon, and Longhorn in general, puts a lot
            of very interesting features together in an integrated API that will benefit developers
            and end users in very exciting ways.&#160; Use your own definition of innovative to
            parse that last sentence.

      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Ha! I get linked from a <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=106586&amp;cid=9070786">comment</a> and
        I see a spike in traffic.&#160; Slashdot is <em>the</em> flow machine.&#160; In any
        case, there are some misstatements in that comment that I'd like to answer.&#160;
        First, I'm not "the guy from Microsoft behind Avalon."&#160; Rather I'm one on a large
        team of developers.&#160; My particular area is the graphics APIs.&#160; Avalon is
        much more than just graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, managed code is a different beast that unmanaged code.&#160; While it can
        make programmers more productive and I totally think that it is the way of the future,
        a developer can write bad code in any language.&#160; While right now I don't think
        that anyone would claim that managed code is faster than unmanaged code, the difference
        is generally not that great.&#160; I've heard of some research that suggests that
        future JITs may be able to apply run time directed optimizations and recompilation
        that <em>could</em> make managed code faster.&#160; But that world isn't here yet.

        I'm done with my part of helping make WinHEC a success.&#160; My talk went off pretty
        well and we got some great questions and comments.&#160; I also worked the booth and
        showed&#160;industry and press people what Longhorn can do.&#160; The big news for
        the WinHEC release is that we now have a start to our 3D APIs.&#160; We had a couple
        of examples that show mixing 3D and 2D in a seamless way.&#160; I tried to go out
        of my way to make sure that everyone knew that Avalon was much more than just graphics.&#160;
        We are a full UI platoform that includes controls, styling, databinding, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main demo I was showing was a simulated "blood sugar tracker."&#160; It essentially
        has a 3D bar graph in the background that slowly rotates.&#160; Layered on that are
        semi-transparent buttons.&#160; There is also a details panel that can come up that
        is semi-transparent and has another 3D scene hosted inside of it.&#160; We have a
        vector graphic doctor icon in the corner that you can zoom in on to see that it is
        rasterized at the device resolution.&#160; The really impressive thing here is that
        our demo team (a dev and a designer) took 2-3 days to turn this from an email idea
        into reality.&#160; Robert and <a href="http://longhornblogs.com/ndunlap/">Nathan</a> did
        a great job of showing the power of Avalon.&#160; Here is a screen shot:

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00180.html">Stress duty</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Mon, Apr 12, 2004</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Here in Windows (and in other groups around the company) we have a system that is
        generally called stress.&#160; Different groups have different implementations, but
        the idea is always the same.&#160; You develop a test suite that hammers you system
        and&#160;then have everyone install it and run it overnight.&#160; The idea is that
        this way we can catch those hard to repro issues that only our customers see. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When you get one of these errors, what do you do with it?&#160; Generally there is
        a team of people who have the thankless job of coming in early, finding all the machines
        that have broken in to the debugger, logging the failures in a database and having
        the system send mail to various people to investigate.&#160; The actual debugging
        is done via the NT command line debugger (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/ddk/debugging/default.mspx">cdb</a>)
        redirected over the network via the remote.exe utility.&#160; It is up to this team
        to figure out which issues have already been caught and fixed (but perhaps aren't
        in the build yet) and what issues are new and need to be investigated.&#160; These
        guys cover a lot of code so the generally don't have the knowledge to figure out what
        developer should be looking at any particular problem.&#160; That falls to the rotating
        list of people who are on "stress duty."&#160; The shell team calls it "dev of the
        day."&#160; We've learned by hard experience that if you send these types of things
        to a big mailing list, they either get ignored or the same sorry glutton for punishment
        picks up all of the issues. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I happen to be on stress duty this week.&#160; My job is to handle, in as expedient
        a fashion as possible, any incoming issues.&#160;&#160;I&#160;have to do my best to
        exercise&#160;my debugging skills and try to figure out what is going on.&#160; BTW, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">Raymond
        Chen</a> is one of the undisputed masters of the cdb kung-fu.&#160; If I can figure
        out what is going on myself, I can file a bug on the issue and let the person whose
        machine I'm debugging reclaim their machine.&#160; If the problem is in code that
        I don't know well it is my job to reassign the issue to someone who does know the
        code well.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond handling incoming stress breaks in the morning, I also have to be responsive
        to all sorts of other issues that might get dropped on the floor.&#160; This includes
        other random crashes people might have during the day along with helping out to resolve
        any build breaks.&#160; (We try super hard to make sure that build breaks don't happen,
        but with something the size of Windows it still sometimes happens.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Do other companies have systems like this set up?&#160; I'd be interested to hear
        what works for you.

        In case you haven't seen it, part of my interview that I did with <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com">Scoble</a>&#160;is
        up at <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com">Channel9</a>.&#160; [BTW, big congrats to

        so soon after launch?]
    </p>
    <p>
        I did a long interview with Scoble and he asked me a lot of questions. It is interesting
        that he the topic of "Is Avalon a way to take over the Web" is the first that they
        put up there.&#160; I'm glad that it is though as this is definately a hot button
        topic.&#160; I'll be sure to keep an eye on the comments on the video and answer any
        questions that you guys have.

        A little background on me: I joined the IE group at Microsoft in the middle of 1997
        right out of college.&#160; I'd interned twice -- once on a forgotten product called
        TeamManager and the second time on the OpenGL inside of Windows.&#160; When working
        on IE, I was responsible for, mostly, the data model for how we stored HTML in memory
        for processing and rendering.&#160; I touched a lot of other code, but my original
        nickname was "Tree Boy" (to <a href="http://www.ericvasilik.com/">Eric Vasilik's</a> "Tree
        Man" :)&#160; If you have questions on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=IMarkupServices">IMarkupServices</a>,
        I can probably answer them for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A couple of years ago, I moved over to the then (very newly) formed Avalon Media Integration
        Layer and helped define the early vision of what we were going to do with 2D UI level
        graphics in Longhorn. (The DX team is all over 3D and games!)&#160; At one point all
        we knew that we wanted was CFS, which stood for "Cool Flying Stuff".&#160; We upgraded
        thaet to "Clickable Flying Stuff" and the graphics strategy for Avalon was born.&#160;
        Since then I've been hard at work helping to define and implement a lot of the graphics
        functionality in Longhorn.&#160; Seriously, I think that we are making a huge leap
        ahead for Windows and look forward to helping everyone understand what we are about.&#160;
        I'm also interested in hearing comments, suggestions and bug reports.

        matter and it is always best to stay positive, I'll withold comment :).

        Dave Winer has a bug up his but to <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/04/06#When:6:58:43PM">try
        and claim</a> that he invented the idea of syndication through XML (embodied via the
        RSS format).&#160; I don't think that anyone will argue that Dave has been syndication's
        biggest evangelist and has driven his fork of the formats forward relentlessly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I just wish he wasn't such an ass.&#160; RSS (and syndication) like so many things
        in the computer world evolved out of a soup of ideas that stretches way back.&#160;
        Every time Dave <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rssVersionHistory">(re)writes
        a history of RSS</a>, he always lists himself as the original invetor and visionary.&#160;
        The particular history linked to above fails to mention a format that was introduced
        with IE 4 called CDF.&#160; This was <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/1997/2/">submitted
        to the W3C</a> at least 9 months before the earliest date on Dave's "history."&#160;
        Now, I'd also venture a guess that there are tons of other prior art in the soup that
        CDF came out of.&#160; For someone who rails against the patent system for the way
        it cements credit for ideas that come out of a soup (think Amazon 1-click) he does
        a good job of trying to "patent" RSS. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The really sad part here is that Dave does himself such a disservice.&#160; He has
        a huge bully pulpit that he could use to push his (often) very good ideas.&#160; Instead,
        he spends time trying to rewrite this particular history.&#160; He undercuts his own
        credibility in the process.&#160; Instead of being an elder statesman of the computer
        industry who can cut through the red tape, he sets himself up as a mini Napoleon and
        creates more divisiveness. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think this quote from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/">The Big Labowski</a>&#160;sums
        up my thoughts on the subject: 
    </p>
    <blockquote><b>Walter</b>: Am I wrong?<br />
    <b>Dude</b>: No you're not wrong.<br />
    <b>Walter</b>: Am I wrong?<br />
    <b>Dude</b>: You're not wrong Walter. You're just an asshole.<br />
    <b>Walter</b>: All right then. </blockquote>

        Never underestimate the throughput of a pigeon.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        While in New Zealand, we went on a caving trip that included a 100 meter abseil (rappel)
        into a cave and then climbed back out.&#160;&#160;One of&#160;the tour guides&#160;had
        a digital camera in a waterproof housing anchored to his harness.&#160; He took some
        pictures of us on the way down and when we got to the bottom.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The tour operator (<a href="http://www.waitomo.co.nz/">Waitomo Adventures</a>) wanted
        pictures from the adventrue to be ready by the time that we returned so that we could
        buy them.&#160; To do this they took&#160;the sony memory stick out of the camera
        and put in in to a little backpack on&#160;a carrier pigeon.&#160; They then let the
        pigeon go and yelled instructions to it on how to get back to the tour office.&#160;
        I think that the pigeon already knew the way, though.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we got back (a 20-25 minute trip in a van) the pigeon had arrived and the staff
        back at the office were busy printing out our pictures.

    </p>
    <p>
        We bought the pictures on CD also, but I don't have those with me right now.&#160;
        I'll post those soon so you can see the fruit of the little pigeon's labor.

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00172.html">DIY Home Theater Screen</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Wed, Mar 24, 2004</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        Somebody named Cash posted a comment asking about my DIY HT Screen.&#160; Here is
        what I did: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Built a 2"x4" frame the size of my screen.&#160; It is a simple rectangle with a supporting
            member in the middle.&#160; I used some screws and metal "fasteners" to make all of
            the right angles. 
        </li>
        <li>
            A friend came over and helped me mount it to the wall.&#160; I did this by securing
            a 2"x4" in to studs in the wall.&#160; I then put small blocks screwed to the back
            of my frame.&#160; The small blocks were then set on top of the 2"x4" on the wall
            and shimmed until the frame was level on the wall.&#160; I also put some blocks of
            wood in the bottom corners to support the bottom. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the frame was level and where I wanted it on the wall I screwed it in to the
            2"x4" that was already attached to the wall. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then put a piece of hardboard (cut by Home Depot) on top of the frame.&#160; This
            is essentially pegboard without the holes.&#160; It is smooth enough and works pretty
            well.&#160; I screwed this around the edges. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then primed and painted the hardboard screen.&#160; 2 coats of primer and 2 coats
            of matte "Misty Evening."&#160; This is a color suggested by <a href="http://avsforum.com">avsforum.com</a>.&#160;
            I used a small can of "Evermore Interior Latex Flat" paint.&#160; The label has code
            "30BG 64/036" next to the Misty Evening name, if that helps.&#160; This was all applied
            with a very fine roller and let dry. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then built a mitered frame out of good quality (no warping) 1"x4"s.&#160;&#160;We
            wrapped these in black material&#160; and stapled it on the back.&#160; I used black
            felt, but I think that black velvet would be better if you can find a cheap source.&#160;
            I then used finish nails to secure this around the edge of the screen and hide all
            of the screw heads.&#160; I punched the nails in and they are now hidden&#160;behind
            the fabric. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The result is probably overbuilt and not as great as a grayhawk screen, but the price
        can't be beat and it looks pretty darn professional.&#160; The black border really
        helps. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me know if you have any questions or want any pictures!&#160; I don't want to
        take it apart or anything :)

        I don't know how many people care, but I'm sorry that I haven't been posting lately!&#160;
        I'll try to make that up some.&#160; Anyway, here is an update of what has been happening: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Went to Cabo San Lucas for a week and relaxed.&#160; It was great to sit in the sun
            at the beach, order a bucket of beers and eat tacos. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Adopted two dogs.&#160; Their names are Lady and Cocoa.&#160; Lady is one and a half
            years old and was rescued from a meth lab and was probably abused.&#160; She hasn't
            shown many signs of it, but you never know what is going to trigger memories of abuse.&#160;
            She had a litter of puppies when she was really young.&#160; Cocoa is the one puppy
            for which the rescuers didn't find a home.&#160; He was her favorite puppy, so we
            adopted them as a pair.&#160; More details and pictures to come later. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I celebrated the one year anniversary of my blog by not posting.&#160; You can find
            the first post <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/01/09.html">here</a> from
            Janurary 9, 2003. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Read lots and lots of books.&#160; I've been reading ebooks on my PocketPC on the
            bus to and from work every day.&#160; I love ebooks! 
        </li>
        <li>
            Started writing some ASP.Net code for a picture gallery over at bedafamily.com.&#160;
            I'd love to finish this up so that I can easily post lots of photos.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I've started recovering from the hibernation that is winter in Seattle.&#160; I want
        to start talking more about what is going on in Avalon and life in general.

        Frank Hileman (no blog, Frank?) has been pounding us (the Avalon team) with some great
        questions.&#160; Most of these have been conversations in comments, but I figured
        that I should bring this to the front page, so to speak. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Of of Frank's concerns, at least as expressed in <em>my</em> comments section, is
        that we are essentially over engineering with the Changeable pattern.&#160; Specifically,
        he says this: 
    </p>
    <blockquote> 
    <p>
        The non-intrusive part of Changeable has a const flag on stock brushes, etc. This
        means the user must clone these and write to a copy. This is simple and easy to understand. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The intrusive part of Changeable is the part which introduces the idea of "used" and
        changes the simple concept of "object reference" into something complicated. From
        what you have explained, the intrusive part of Changeable exists only to allow simultaneous
        multi-threaded writers to the scene graph. 
    </p>
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
        I think that the point around threading is a red-herring here.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Changeable Requirements</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        The main problem that changeables are trying to solve is that we want to have, under
        most circumstances, these changeable API objects (Brush, Pen, etc.) act like value
        types and other times we want them to act like refernce types.&#160; We essentially
        want to walk a fine line and get advantages from each.&#160; Frank, forgive me if
        you've heard a bunch of this before, but I think that this is useful to put together
        in one place. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With respect to value types, we want the simple user semantic to be: Modify my local
        copy and have it be disconnected or "severed" when I pass it in to another object.&#160;
        When rendering this means that I can do this: 
    </p>
    <pre>SolidColorBrush&#160;scb = new&#160;SolidColorBrush();
scb.Color = Colors.Blue;
myDrawingContext.DrawGeometry(scb, null /*pen*/, myGeometry1);
scb.Color = Colors.Red;
myDrawingContext.DrawGeometry(scb, null /*pen*/, myGeometry2);
</pre>
    <p>
        and have my two geometries be drawn with different colors.&#160; Since many times
        the drawing context is writing in to a metafile like data structure, if we used pure
        reference semantics both geometries would be drawn as Red.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another example is setting properties in to a set of elements: 
    </p>
    <pre>SolidColor Brush scb = new SolidColorBrush();
scb.Color = Colors.Blue;
myElement1.Background = scb;
myElement2.Background = scb;

// in some other code...
((SolidColorBrush)myElement1.Background).Color = Colors.Red;</pre>
    <p>
        I think, in most cases, if some user walks up to an element, such as myElement1 above,
        and sets the background brush, he doesn't expect that this will have the side effect
        of changing the background brush of another element.&#160; Side effects like this
        would make for an unstable system. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Value types don't solve all of our problems though!&#160; We also want the efficiencies
        and advanatages of making these be reference types.&#160; Specifically, we want to
        have to have hierarchies, not have to copy the entire thing around and be able to
        save space by having multiple places reference the same thing.&#160; We imagine a
        world with lots of elements getting their values via styling.&#160; Because of this,
        we want the normal case be that a user puts a value in to a style block somewhere
        and then that object (via reference) gets widely shared, perhaps between hundreds
        of elements.&#160; We obviously want to make the per-reference cost as small as possible
        here.&#160; Going with a pure value type system won't work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Builder Pattern</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        The first cut at solving this problem was called the Builder Pattern.&#160; This pattern
        was a generalization of the StringBuilder pattern.&#160; Specifically, for each type,
        there was a companion, or Builder type.&#160; The main type was immutable.&#160; In
        other words, any write operations would raise an exception.&#160; So, for SolidColorBrush,
        we wrote a SolidColorBrushBuilder.&#160; SolidColorBrush was immutable while SolidColorBrushBuilder
        was a fully writeable object.&#160; All of the APIs in the system (property types
        on element, parameters in to DrawingContext methods, etc.) took the non-builder types.&#160;
        To create one of those non-builder types, the user had to do one of the following: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Create the target type directly by using a constructor. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a builder, configure it, and call the ToXXX method on it to construct the main
            type. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a builder by initializing it off of its companion type.&#160; Make a delta
            and call the ToXXX method to construct the main type. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        From one point of view, this is a great system.&#160; It is very explicit (at compile
        time) what is editable and what isn't.&#160; However, some early users of our system
        (ad-hoc usability) ended up really disliking this system.&#160; The need to constantly
        deal with both types was onourous.&#160; It also meant that the user could never just
        index directly in to a type and change it.&#160;&#160;To affect any change, it&#160;was
        always necessary to create the builder, make the change, and set the old value in. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Changeable Pattern</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        In response to a hail of internal criticism on the Builder Pattern we went back and
        came up with the Changeable pattern.&#160; The idea is that we would have one type
        object with an immutable bit.&#160; Once the immutable bit gets set, all further changes
        to that object will throw.&#160; This opens the way up to runtime errors (instead
        of compile time errors) but makes certain "delta" scenarios much easier to deal with. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we still wanted to solve the problems listed in the first part of this post.&#160;
        Specifically, we didn't want to leave it up to the user to manually flip the immutable
        bit.&#160; In this way we defined certain types of operations that would automatically
        create a copy and flip the immutable bit for you if necessary.&#160; We then went
        further and added advanced modes so that those APIs either make a copy but <em>don't</em> flip
        the immutable bit or the APIs just take a reference.&#160; These last modes (whereby
        something like an element holds on to a <em>mutable</em> brush) were never possible
        with the Builder pattern. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We also added a notification mechanism so that someone who does hold on to an object
        that isn't immutable can learn when that object changes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, do you guys (Frank?) like the more explicit builder pattern better?&#160; More
        questions?

        Vince (who I knew in high school as Steve) wrote in my comments:

        How can I get to the underlying DX9-esque interface I know you guys gotta be using

        DrawPrimitive, push buffers, and pain-in-the ass ITexture objects. 
    </p>
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
        Don't worry dude!&#160; The details are still being worked out, but we know that we
        have to make it possible for people to interop with old code, and with DX.&#160; At
        the very least, you will be able to host another hwnd window that is written using
        GDI/User or DX.&#160; The details on when and how DX will get accelerated, and how
        it will play with the rest of the system are still TBD.&#160; At the very least, when
        you go full screen with DX you will own the device.
    </p>
    <p>
        For simple 3D stuff (load up a model and spin it around like a 3D icon) we will have
        our own 3D API that doesn't pretent to offer all of the flexibility of D3D.
    </p>
    <p>
        What specific scenarios are you interested in?&#160; My thinking is that you might
        want to write a tool and have the UI done with Avalon and the "canvas" of the tool
        done via D3D.&#160; In this scenario, you are in a windowed situation and Avalon is
        on top.&#160; The 3D stuff is running in a window in an Avalon app.&#160; Another
        scenario that might be interesting is that you have a D3D app/game and you are using
        Avalon to drive 2D type UI inside of the game environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can't promise that all of the scenarios will be doable, but let me know what is
        most important to you.

        I went to a great holiday party last night thrown by my neighbors, Bob and Carol.&#160;
        We moved in quite a while ago&#160;but hadn't really had a chance to interact with
        any of our neighbors yet.&#160; This was a great opportunity for us to not only chat
        with our hosts, but also others from around the neighborhood.&#160; It turns out that
        the internet makes the world even smaller.&#160; Bob had run across my blog and already
        knew more about me (or at least my work!) than I knew about him.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also chatted with our neighbors on the other side, Gary and Marge.&#160; Gary is
        a long time photographer that just recently went digital with a Canon 10D and a sweet
        lens setup.&#160; He sent me a link to some of <a href="http://pbase.com/mgmoogk">his
        images</a>.&#160; These were done with film -- a Pentax 6x7 that he recently sold.&#160;
        I really need to get off of my butt and put together a gallery of some of my better

      <span class="lead">Tue, Dec 2, 2003</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dmarsh/">Drew Marsh</a>&#160;posted an interesting
        article entitled "<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dmarsh/posts/40626.aspx">Avalon
        Dissected</a>."&#160; It is great to see people taking an interest in Avalon at this
        level.&#160; However, he got some of the details around Visuals wrong. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The graphics system in Avalon is new and is built to take advantage of the hardware.&#160;
        Beyond this, there is a software engine for the cases when the hardware isn't supported.&#160;
        On top of this, we've built a "scene graph" system that natively supports animation
        and remoting.&#160; In the normal case, the actual rendering of the scene graph is
        done on a dedicated composition thread where third party code isn't allowed to run.&#160;
        The description of everything on screen and some primitive animation information is
        passed to this thread so that the rendering can happen independently of what is going
        on with the regular UI thread.&#160; In the case when you are running an Avalon application
        from a remote machine (via Terminal Services or Remote Desktop) with an advanced client,
        this composition thread will run on the remote machine and the actual rendering of
        the scene graph will happen without any network traffic.&#160; Some animations will
        be able to run on the remote machine without network traffic also.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        From the programming model point of view, a node in our scene graph is&#160;called <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/c/visual/visual.aspx">Visual</a>.&#160;
        There are different types of visuals that are intended to be used for different purposes.&#160;
        It is also important to note that UIElement derives from Visual so every UIElement <em>is-a</em> Visual.&#160;
        (At one point an Element <em>had-a</em> visual but this was changed with the rearchitecture
        that <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/359c73aa-4711-4061-b9d9-16300d8d278e">talks
        about</a>.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Every Visual implements an interface called <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/i/ivisual/ivisual.aspx">IVisual</a>.&#160;
        There is no situation where a third user should be implementing IVisual.&#160; The
        reason that we created this interface is so that we can use&#160;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/csref/html/vcwlkExplicitInterfaceImplementationTutorial.asp">explicit
        interface implementation</a> to hide the methods on IVisual.&#160; We didn't want
        to pollute the public object model for UIElement (and Button, etc.) with things that
        most users weren't going to be using. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A Visual has the following capabilities: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Children with a transform on each child 
        </li>
        <li>
            Opacity 
        </li>
        <li>
            Clip 
        </li>
        <li>
            Content (defined differently for each visual type) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Hit testing services 
        </li>
        <li>
            Coordinate transformation services 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bounding box services 
        </li>
        <li>
            And in the future: blend mode and effect 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For each visual, the content of that visual is rendered followed by the children,
        from left to right.&#160; The Z-order of any children are completely implied by their
        order in the visual tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        Different specializations of Visual provide for specific types of content and for
        different flavors of public programming model.&#160; Here are the main ones: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/c/containervisual/containervisual.aspx">ContainerVisual</a>.&#160;
            This Visual has all of its&#160;capabilities reflected publically and has no intrinsic
            content. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/c/drawingvisual/drawingvisual.aspx">DrawingVisual</a>.&#160;
            This Visual also has all of its capabilties reflected publically.&#160; Its content
            is 2D vector data that is stored with it.&#160; You can think of it holding on to
            a "metafile."&#160; The way you change the content is&#160;call&#160;<a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/c/drawingvisual/m/renderopen.aspx">DrawingVisual.RenderOpen</a>,
            get a DrawingContext and draw with that. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/c/retainedvisual/retainedvisual.aspx">RetainedVisual</a>.&#160;
            This guy is special.&#160;&#160;He is meant to be derived from.&#160; This is the
            Visual that UIElement derives from.&#160; All of the services and properties are available
            either via private functions (RenderOpen) or via the IVisual interface only.&#160;
            This visual can work in two modes: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Fully retained.&#160; This is the default case.&#160; In this case the visual is exacly
                    like&#160;a DrawingVisual except the IVisual members are not reexposed in a public
                    way.&#160; RenderOpen is also protected instead of private. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    On&#160;demand&#160;retained.&#160; If the&#160;derived class implements <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/i/iretainedrender/iretainedrender.aspx">IRetainedRender</a>&#160;and
                    sets the protected <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/c/retainedvisual/p/renderbounds.aspx">RenderBounds</a> property,
                    then <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/ns/msavalon.windows.media/i/iretainedrender/m/render.aspx">IRetainedRender.Render</a> will
                    be called back as necessary to fill in the "metafile" for this Visual.&#160; They
                    system looks at the tree and decides, based on the RenderBounds, if this Visual is
                    on screen.&#160; If it is, then the system calls IRetainedRender.Render and&#160;the
                    derived class writes into the "metafile" via&#160;a DrawingContext passed.&#160; The
                    system then caches that metafile.&#160; If the Visual is then pushed off screen for
                    some reason(scrolling, perhaps), then the system is free to throw away the cached
                    metafile to save space.&#160; The user can force the system to throw away the metafile
                    by calling the protected RetainedVisual.InvalidateVisual call.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When it comes time to render (scheduled via the Dispatcher class and coordinated with
        the animation system and layout) the system will walk the tree and decide what is
        and isn't on screen.&#160; It will then call render on any RetainedVisuals as necessary
        and cache the result.&#160; It also updates the data on the other thread for what
        is on screen so that the render can happen async from what is going on on the UI thread.&#160;
        In this way, there is no "render" happening on the UI thread in the normal case.&#160;
        Instead we are "compiling" the scene graph down to a simpler representation to run
        asynchronously on another thread or on another machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bits that we shipped in the PDC don't have this system fully implemented.&#160;
        For example, the composition thread isn't running completely async and we don't have
        rich TS support in.&#160; Come beta, more of our system will be completed and up and
        working.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm sure that this is confusing and that I've missed some stuff, so feel free to ask
        questions and I'll do my best to answer.

        Chris -- Thanks for the <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/c8dae103-c610-4829-bc2d-d9fcb32be084">comments</a> on
        my theater plans.&#160; I really want to come over and see your setup as long as you
        promise me I won't drown.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chris mentioned Paradigms.&#160; I have a set of Paradigm Reference Studio/40 v2 and
        I love them.&#160; I don't want to take those and repurpose them from my living room
        to my theater so I'm starting over from that respect.&#160; Getting a full HT setup
        with the Studio line is probably more than I want to spend.&#160; However, I've been
        reading good things about the Monitor series.&#160; If I can get a good price on them
        from north of the border, I'll probably do that.&#160; (I was thinking B&amp;W too,
        but I like the sound of my Studio/40s.)
    </p>
    <p>
        With respect to the Infocus ScreenPlay 4800, that projector is just the Infocus X1
        repackaged for the home theater retail channel.&#160; It costs a good $300 more for
        essentially the same projector.&#160; I think that I'm going to up the ante a little
        bit and I now have a <a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/Sanyo-PLV-Z2.htm">Sanyo</a> <a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/sanyo_plv_z2.htm">Z2</a> on
        order.&#160; This is a much higher resolution (720p native) 16:9 LCD projector.&#160;
        It costs more, but I think that the resolution is going to be worth it.&#160; Supposedly
        the latest round of LCD projectors have the contrast ratio that the DLPs are famous
        for.&#160; Beyond this the Z2 has a DVI input.
    </p>
    <p>
        I couldn't get the deal on the Yamaha RXV1400 that I thought I could (even though
        I love the idea of a feedback based autocalibration feature) so I'm thinking the Denon
        3803 now.&#160; My current 2ch reciever is a Denon and I'm pretty happy with that.&#160;
        I'll see if I can get a good deal on the 3803.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond that, I'm going to paint the wall or go with&#160;painted fiber board to begin
        with and then look at buying a screen.&#160; I'm not sure what size I want yet!&#160;
        (6.25ftx3.5ft sounds good to start with.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Doing this whole home theater thing is a blast!&#160; There is so much to learn and
        read.&#160; There are tons of good forums and review sites.&#160; The process of just
        figuring out what I'm going to get is a huge undertaking in and of itself.

        I went on one to Death Valley last year with Steve Kossack.&#160; He knows the area

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00153.html">Avalon, XAML and SVG</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Tue, Nov 4, 2003</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        There has been a ton of speculation on SVG and its relationship (or lack thereof)
        to Avalon.&#160; Here is some thoughts on that, collected from various responses I've
        made or others have made. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Our rendering model is very much like that of SVG.&#160; We support a hierarchical
            compositing model with transforms that affect items in the hiearchy. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Our markup isn't the same mostly because XAML is a direct reflection of the programming
            model.&#160; There is a very solid relationship between the markup and the objects
            and methods. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Our OM doesn't match the SVG DOM because we choose to go with an object model that
            more closely matches what we think <em>our</em> users expect.&#160; Specifically,
            we tried hard to make sure that our object model provided a certain amount of consistency
            with WinForms (and VB and MFC before it)&#160;and ASP.Net.&#160; Beyond this, our
            object model is strongly typed where much of the SVG DOM is based around strings.&#160; 
        </li>
        <li>
            WVG is a term that we are no longer using and isn't, in my opinion, very useful.&#160;
            We were supposed to have scrubbed this from our documentation, but apparently we missed
            some stuff.&#160; There is no strick subset of Avalon objects and XAML markup that
            stands on its own with respect to vector graphics.&#160; 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Whereas when using SVG inside of XHTML there is a very&#160;bright line, when using
                    a vector graphic element in a UI authored in XAML, there is no sharp line.&#160; You
                    can put a Rectangle element, for example, in flow with a document without a Canvas
                    element.&#160; To do a similar thing with XHTML/SVG, you would need to wrap all SVG
                    content in an SVG element.&#160; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    For Avalon, the set of properties and property types is the same between vector graphics
                    elements and other elements.&#160; In this way the background property for a Button
                    is of type Brush -- the same as the fill property for a Rectangle. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are elements that can very easily be seen to belong to both a control subset
                    and a vector graphics subset.&#160; For example, Image makes sense in a UI sense but
                    also in a VG sense.&#160; XHTML and SVG both have image elements.&#160; We avoid this
                    duplicity.&#160; Text is another area where we avoid a large amount of duplication. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            While we share a rendering model with SVG to a large extent, our support and features
            don't match up completely.&#160; Some of it is stuff that we haven't implemented yet
            and others are due to choices that we've made because of programming model concerns.&#160;
            I'll try to put together a guide on this stuff at some point in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I'm sure there are questions around SVG and XAML/Avalon that I haven't answered here.&#160;
        Post in the comments and I'll update this post with the latest and greatest.

        Actually, I'm proud of the work that we are doing on Avalon, but I hate the name.&#160;
        It just sounds lame and dorky to me.&#160; I guess this is what you get when you vote
        on a code name.&#160; Aero and Indigo are much better names.&#160; In fact, the shell
        team has the best code names:&#160;Aero, Jade, Luna, Plex.&#160; I guess it is because
        they have designers who are creative types.
    </p>
    <p>
        The worst code name I can think of right now was for NT4.&#160; It started out being
        just and update to the shell.&#160; So, it was called the "Shell Update Release" that
        got abbreviated SUR.&#160; They even made T-Shirts that said "We don't need any stinkin'
        code name."
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyone haved examples of other really bad code names for projects?

        <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/10.html"><font color="#336699">Joel's
        post</font></a> a couple of days ago reminded me of a conversation I had about a year
        ago with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=michael+stokes+color"><font color="#336699">Michael
        Stokes</font></a>, a PM in our group at the time dealing with color.&#160; Specifically,
        we were talking about how color profiles work and how scRGB makes the world a better
        place. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm going to do my best to explain this, but I'm simplifying some of it and I can't
        claim to be a color expert.&#160; There are many people out there who know much more
        about this than I do, but I don't think I've seen any body present this to the average
        programmer.&#160; It goes like this -- there is color data (similar to an 8 bit char)
        and there is the color profile that describes how to interpret that data (similar
        to a codepage).&#160; The combination of the&#160;color&#160;and the color profile
        give you everything you need, in theory,&#160;to get accurate color. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a simple standard color space called sRGB which is a formalization of the
        ad hoc "standard" that has developed over the years.&#160; It is a color space that
        most monitors and graphics cards support by default.&#160; In other words, if you
        send&#160;raw RGB data to today's graphics hardware, the thing you see on the screen
        will be within spitting distance of the sRGB standard.&#160; This is in some ways
        a parallel to the ASCII with text.&#160; What we end up with is a standard that works
        well if all you are interested in is showing something on a monitor and you don't
        care too much about the accuracy of the color.&#160; This is all good and fine as
        long as you aren't too picky about the color of the shirt you are buying from JCrew.com. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Things start to get complicated once you start talking about gamut.&#160; Any particular
        device that deals with color (camera, scanner, screen, printer, etc.) has a gamut.&#160;
        The gamut is the range of physical colors that the device can operate with.&#160;
        There are colors that you can see that your monitor cannot produce.&#160; Similarly,
        there are colors that your monitor can produce that your printer can't print.&#160;
        There are probably even colors that your printer can&#160;put on paper&#160;that your
        monitor can't display.&#160; In other words, there are physical limitations and characteristics
        built in to any device.&#160; Since profiles a color space, they too have a gamut. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The sad part here is that sRGB is defined around how computer display hardware happened
        to work.&#160; There are colors that fall outside of the definition of sRGB.&#160;
        In fact, there are <em>lots </em>of colors that fall outside of the sRGB gamut.&#160;
        My camera (a Canon D60) can capture colors that can't be described by sRGB.&#160;
        It is like trying to describe a sanskrit character with 7 bit ASCII.&#160; My printer
        (an Epson 1270) can print colors are also outside of sRGB.&#160; Since I'm in photography
        for artistic purposes, I'm a bit of a perfectionist and not happy with limiting the
        colors in my prints by what my monitor can and can't display. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The logical next step here is to redefine the color space so that we can represent
        colors that sRGB can't represent.&#160; Lots of people have done this.&#160; The most
        popular color space out there (outside of sRGB) would be AdobeRGB 98 that Adobe popularized
        via Photoshop.&#160;Reality is that if you define the gamut to be too narrow you end
        up excluding colors and if you expand the gamut too much you end with too few gradations
        in colors you care about.&#160; This makes your smooth blue sky look like an&#160;Aztec
        pyramid.&#160; Because there is a tradeoff here, everyone and their brother have created
        a color space to fit&#160;a particular need.&#160; The result is that 0xFF0000 (using
        web syntax) means different things depending on the color space that you are using
        to interpret it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sophisticated software both built into Windows (and Mac OS) and into photoshop does
        the translation between the data and your screen.&#160; Or from your data to your
        printer.&#160; Or from you data into a "working color space" and then into the color
        space of your printer.&#160; This color management software essentially manages mapping
        from one space to another.&#160; Oh yeah, and don't forget that converting from one
        space to another is a lossy operation.&#160; All is good and&#160;lightness, right? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, no. Just like 8 bit characters and codepages, it is all too easy to ignore this
        stuff and just hope for the best.&#160; Almost every consumer level device outputs
        sRGB, most printer drivers assume sRGB incoming and almost every picture on the web
        is authored to sRGB (unless it is authored on a Mac which uses a 1.8 gamma space instead
        of the 2.2 gamma as defined in sRGB).&#160; If most developers just stick their head
        in the sand and ignore it, then things will mostly work themselves out.&#160; If you
        take a photo that is encoded in AdobeRGB and interpret it as sRGB, things will mostly
        work -- it will just look pretty washed out. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Add to this the fact that right now it isn't clear what piece of software is supposed
        to translate form what space in to whatever other space and at what time and we have
        a mess on our hands.&#160; Your camera captures more data than can fit in to sRGB
        but it may throw that data away and store your photo in sRGB.&#160; Photoshop loads
        this up and throws a dialog that most users have no idea what to do with.&#160; When
        you print there are an array of choices in both Photoshop and the printer driver.
        To be honest, I do some of this stuff for a living and I've wasted a lot of paper
        trying to figure out what the right settings are. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The state of the color union is that most people have just given up and standardized
        on sRGB across the board.&#160; This is really a shame because we can do so much more.&#160;
        We are shortchanging ourselves.&#160; This is like asking the entire world to just
        learn English. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The&#160;way out is Unicode, err, scRGB.&#160; I'm honestly not sure what the 'sc'
        in scRGB stands for.&#160; scRGB defines a gamut that is much wider than anything
        you or I can see.&#160; All of the other custom color spaces that have been defined
        fit inside of scRGB.&#160; However, this comes at a price.&#160; If you were to take
        an image and encode it in scRGB at 8 bits per channel (bpc), your image would look
        like crap.&#160; The expanded gamut means that we need much more precision to avoid
        the color granularity problem described above.&#160; 8bpc isn't good enough.&#160;
        And you thought we would never need anything more than 16.7 million colors!&#160;
        The cost of unifying all of the various color spaces is 16bpc or even 32bpc.&#160;
        Sure it costs more, but your pictures are worth it, right?&#160; Jumping up to 16
        or 32bpc may seem like a huge leap, but it probably isn't that big a deal in practice.&#160;
        Memory and disk space is cheap and this stuff can compress pretty well.&#160; Unicode
        was painful at one point but it is definitely worth it now.&#160; Beyond this, when
        persisting this stuff out, there are ways to encode scRGB data that recognizes that
        most of the extra precision isn't needed in many common cases.&#160; This is similar
        to the UTF-8 or UTF-16 encodings for UCS-4 (in unicode speak). 
    </p>
    <p>
        The benifits to this switch are huge.&#160; All of the color data that you might want
        to store can be represented in the scRGB model.&#160; Whereas in today's model converting
        to any particular color space could be a mistake, converting to scRGB is generally
        never the wrong thing to do.&#160; With the extended gamut you can be sure that you
        won't have to clamp or compress your colors and with the extra precision you mitigate
        the lossyness of&#160;the conversion.&#160; If the printer driver speaks scRGB it
        can do the best job it knows how to get that on to the paper.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        scRGB is the Unicode of color.

        <strong>Update on April 30, 2005</strong> 
        <br />
        This article has been in the top 3 results for "scRGB" on Google for quite a while.&#160;
        I was chatting with Michael Stokes (Color Architect at Microsoft) and he had some
        comments to add on the naming of scRGB: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>The "sc" in "scRGB" is not defined by IEC, but the annex uses the term
    "specular component" and that is probably the closest thing to a true definition that
    IEC has provided.&#160; Historically it was called "sRGB-X" then "XsRGB" (but the
    marketing folks didn't like "excess" in the pronunciation) and then "sRGB-64" but
    that was too close to Nintendo 64 and finally "scRGB" but it is all the same thing. </blockquote>

        This afternoon I went to some meetings on how to present yourself as a Microsoft employee
        for the PDC.&#160; It was mostly predictable -- use common sense when talking to customers,
        don't badmouth competitors and be careful around the press.&#160; However, one thing
        that stuck out in my mind is the fact that we are now encouranged to hand out our
        business cards.&#160; In the past, it was considered a virtue to keep the development
        team from getting "distracted" by direction interaction with customers.&#160; I like
        this new approach a lot more.

        I made the cut and I'm going to be going to the PDC.&#160; Here is the where and when
        of where I'm going to be for sure: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I will be proctoring some of the client "Hands On Labs."&#160; I'll be working Monday,
            Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm going to be an Expert at the "Ask the Experts" event on Tuesday night.&#160; I
            don't remember the exact name of the table/room we'll be in, but look for the closest
            thing to Avalon client graphics. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'll be cheering Greg Schechter on as he presents an in depth intro to Avalon graphics
            at the CLI341 breakout on Tuesday afternoon (3:45-5:00). 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm not scheduled to officially man the Avalon booth, but I'll probably be hanging
            out there some of the time. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Anything else you guys think I should hit?&#160; Some of the "Birds of a Feather"
        sessions look like fun.&#160; The one titled: "Strategic Decisions and Rich Client
        War Stories: Designing today for "Whidbey" and "Longhorn"" looks good along with the
        "VS.NET Secret Tips &amp; Tricks" session.&#160; "What is Windows in an HD World?"
        looks like fun too!

    <p>
        I'm sure everyone has seen this now, but <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/10.html">Joel
        is dead on</a> wrt Unicode.&#160; I worked on some of the codepage reloading stuff
        in IE so I've lived some of this stuff -- Both recognizing the BOM for Unicode and
        implementing the reload of an already started page when we hit the codepage meta.&#160;
        Most of IE is fully unicode of course.&#160; The only exception is when we deal with
        URLs because, back in the day, they were restricted to 7bit ascii. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some other issues that Joel didn't bring up that devs should be aware of: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sorting unicode is hard.&#160; Each language has its own sort rules.&#160; Given any
            particular set of strings, they may be sorted differently depending on the language. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Capitilization can be hard also.&#160; There was a bug in IE at one point where we
            didn't deal with capitilization of a japanese string right and someone's name was
            transformed into "dead body on beach."&#160; At the very least that is a rude thing
            to call someone. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Be aware that text that looks the same on the screen can be backed by different unicode
            codepoints.&#160; This is a problem with going to unicode for URLs as it makes domain
            squating more difficult to deal with.&#160; Two people might own two domains that
            look the same when typed in but are instead actually two different domains from a
            unicode codepoint point of view.&#160; As an analogy, I was looking at an ancient
            typewriter the other day that one of our PMs has outside of her office.&#160; It doesn't
            have a '1' key!&#160; The solution is to just use the 'l' (L) key instead.&#160; Now
            imagine if the keys are font glyphs as displayed on the screen and the concept of
            '1' and 'l' are unicode codepoints.&#160; 'He11o' and 'Hello' would look exactly alike
            on the screen but would actually be different domains.</li>

        Canon <a href="http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/eosdigital/index.html">just announced</a> the
        new 300D.&#160; The camera itself is ugly, and it is an annoying all flash site, but
        it looks like this could bust things open.&#160; Current prices for DSLRs (the 10D)
        is around $1350.&#160; Dropping this below $1000 could really expand the market.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm just waiting to read some reviews and see how this is positioned relative to the
        10D.&#160; Reiner and Alice (Reiner is a personality in the NT world) just got a 10D
        and I was playing with it the other day.&#160; It just feels more solid than my D60.&#160;
        I hope that the 10D feels the same way, even though it is covered with chrome crap
        (like the Elan IIe film camera I started with).

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00124.html">OSX not a 64 bit OS</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Mon, Jul 28, 2003</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/06/26.html">Earlier</a>, I was
        wondering if the new G5 Macs would have an OS that could take advantage of their 64
        bit nature, or if Apple was going to take a short cut and run the G5 in a compat mode.&#160;
        Apparently, that <em>is</em> going to be the case, at least according to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/31995.html">this
        Register article</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a lot of ways, this is just more hype from Apple.&#160; Many Intel processesors
        (I don't know the exact ones) actually have a 36 bit addressing bus.&#160; Those extra
        4 bits mean that the processor can actually address 16 times as much memory as a 32
        bit addressing bus.&#160; The difference is between 4GB and 64GB.&#160; However, most
        Windows machines don't take advantage of that extra capacity.&#160; The APIs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp?frame=true">are
        there</a> though, if you want to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, is the 64 bit nature of the G5 hype?&#160; As far as I can tell, right now the
        answer is yes.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Well, I'm sure that someone will port 64 bit Linux to it, and that will be cool.&#160;
        It might become the cheapest way to get a 64 bit linux machine, if AMD doesn't beat
        them to the punch)

    </p>
    <p>
        However, I'm not a PM.&#160; I'm a Dev Lead.&#160; I don't know if everyone knows
        the break down of different jobs at Microsoft, but, in the technical areas, there
        are three main jobs: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/programmanagement.aspx">Program
        Management</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaredevelopment.aspx">Development</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaretesting.aspx">Test</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The breakdown goes like this:&#160; PMs talk to customers, develop requirements and
        write specs, Devs implement the code to those specs and Test validates that the Devs
        did their job.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, things never work out that cleanly.&#160; For example, the Test team are
        some of the people first using the product so they may have more and better feedback
        than just if the program works.&#160; And in a techinical area, like what I'm working
        on (graphics and APIs), a lot of the design work can be done by devs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft is trying to develop higher level individual contributer developers to help
        lead the architecture of the product.&#160; I'm heading down that track right now.&#160; <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> is
        another example of this.&#160; Part of this is that just because you are good at writing
        code doesn't mean that you are good at managing people.&#160; Beyond that, it is <em>really</em> hard
        to find PMs that can operate at the technical level necessary for some groups -- such
        as designing windows APIs.&#160; As a result of this, higher level individual contributer
        devs and technical PMs do many of the same jobs.&#160; This is why I've spent that
        last year or so writing specs!

        The house stuff is winding down.&#160; We close on August 18th, and I think that we

        On top of that, Rachel and I took this week off to move and buy a house.&#160; We've
        made an offer and they have accepted!&#160; The inspection is on Sunday and we are
        figuring out mortgage and insurance stuff.&#160; The house is in the <a href="http://montlake.net/montlake.asp">Montlake</a> neighborhood
        of Seattle.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The house is withing walking distance to the University hospital so, Rachel can walk
        to work most of the time.&#160; The rest of the time there are free shuttles that
        run from the U hospital to the other hospitals around Seattle.&#160; The house is
        also close enough to the freeway bus stop so I can stop sitting in my car and start
        sitting in a bus.&#160; Microsoft has a really good bus commuter program where anyone
        can get a free bus pass.

    <p>
        Just wondering, but does anyone know if Mac OS X actually allows processes to run
        with a full 64 bit address space?&#160; Or is everything just running in a 32 bit
        compat mode?&#160; I couldn't see anything with a quick search on Apple's web page.
    </p>
    <p>
        WinNT ran on the 64 bit alpha quite a while ago, but it only ran in a 32 bit mode.&#160;
        Is Apple doing the same thing here?&#160; Is the whole 64 bit thing, wrt Apple, all
        flash and no fire?
    </p>
    <p>
        BTW, just because the&#160;new&#160;G5 machines&#160;can have 8GB of RAM doesn't mean
        that an <em>individual</em> process can access more than 4GB.&#160; Hell,&#160;some
        Intel procs&#160;can access &gt;4Gb, but they are still 32 bit processors.&#160; For
        example, the 32 bit version of W2k3 server can support 32GB of RAM.&#160; This extra
        RAM can be accessed via specialized APIs or you can have, for example, 10 processes
        each using 2GB.

        <li>
            Fixed FTP issues with multi-line responses from FTP server.</li>
        <li>
            Added a "FilePutDelay" parameter to the site1.config file for dealing with FTP servers

        I freakin' hate ticketmaster.&#160; I just had to buy a baseball ticket -- just one
        as we have another person going to the game.&#160; The base ticket price is $16 but
        the total ended up being $22.81.&#160; That is a 43% service charge.&#160; That is
        more than I pay in income tax. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond this, I had to actually use the phone instead of doing it online because I
        wanted to get a seat as close to my other tickets.&#160; In addition to ripping me
        off they: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Asked for my email address to send me confirmation and then asked me if it is okay
            to sign me up to some random&#160;spam list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to sports illustrated. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to entertainment weekly. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to entice me to some other offer that I didn't catch because the poor guy in
            their phone center was mumbling. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Selling tickets can't be that hard a business to run.&#160; Are these guys just money
        hungry?

        I just don't get the excitement around 802.11a and 802.11g standards.&#160; Sure --
        5 times as fast would be nice, but in reality, I'm not using my wireless connection
        for anything that requires faster speeds.&#160; God knows my broadband connection
        can't keep up with 11Mbps.&#160; And if I do (like copying GBs of photos around) I
        just plug in to an ethernet cable. I know, eventually we'll get video on demand and
        all sorts of other high end services over these wireless links.
    </p>
    <p>
        802.11b strikes a great balance of speed and range.&#160; The build-out is happening.&#160;
        Why is the press trying to make such a big deal of it?&#160; Or is it not the press
        and there are people who are&#160;really excited about this stuff?

    <p>
        (10Gb ethernet might be more interesting as this means the network is approaching
        bus speeds.)

        If it isn't apparent from other sources, I work for Microsoft.&#160; Obviously, I
        cant speak for the company, but I'd like to draw attention to some comments from Steve
        Ballmer in the recent memo that he sent to us.&#160; <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> has
        these comments <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/05.html#a3206">posted</a> on
        his blog and I don't want to see them get lost in the shuffle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        SteveB wrote: "Many customers, MVP's, employees, and industry analysts have said to
        us that people would appreciate our innovations more and the value we deliver if they
        knew the company and its people better." and&#160; "To generate enthusiasm for our
        company and innovations, we must also communicate more broadly and in a more human
        and compelling voice." 
    </p>
    <p>
        In case you haven't noticed, this blog (and many others) are a grassroots effort from
        within the company to do just what Steve is asking.&#160; What would you like to see?&#160;
        How do you think that we can execute on this mission of transparency?

        In my opinion, we have a long road ahead to dig ourselves out of the hole that we've

        RSS is a part of the puzzle but only captures a part of what is on a site.&#160; What
        would you need to move in to the post browser era? 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A "site.xml" file to describe the type of content available at the site. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This could point to a set of blogs available on that site.&#160; Bubba (and a lot
            of others) expose more than one blog, or view of their blog.&#160; Perhaps this is
            just a pointer to an RSS file. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Included in each RSS file a pointer to the archive for that is important too.&#160;
            Winer has some stuff on that a while ago that could easily be integrated here. 
        </li>
        <li>
            A reference from the "site.xml" file to other resources available on that site.&#160;
            This could include a list of "stories" and photo galleries.&#160; Perhaps specific
            pages like a disclaimer/license page, a contacts page, etc. 
        </li>
        <li>
            We could use XHTML for all unstructured content that isn't covered otherwise. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is an incremental&#160;start on the semantic web.&#160; If we start with XHTML
        and start pulling stuff out on a piece by piece basis we can start to reduce the amount
        of unstructured content.

    <p>
        Actually, reaching way back into my memory, I seem to remember that we had, or almost
        had, a feature like this in IE4.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The story goes like this: starting with IE4 we switched over to the new advanced Trident
        rendering engine (mshtml.dll). We worked super hard to be compatible with all of NS3's
        quirky behavior.&#160; One thing that our architecture made it very hard for us to
        handle is the case where someone had both a &lt;frameset&gt; and &lt;body&gt; on the
        same page.&#160; Netscape handled this one way and it was really hard for us to do
        the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer that we came up with at the time was to have an "analyze" dialog that would
        look at the page and tell you why it wasn't doing what you wanted it to do.&#160;
        I don't think that anything really came of it and it was pulled at some point.&#160;
        The particular markup behavior that pushed us toward a solution like this disappeared
        from the web as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This wasn't a true "validate" dialog at such, but the push for pure wasn't there back
        in 97.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not making any excuses here, but I think that everyone can agree that one of the
        reasons that IE was so successful at that time was because it could consume everything
        that was already out there on the net -- and that meant very careful duplication of
        all of netscapes bugs.

            like that has tained me.</li>
        <li>
            I'm really excited about the server and what we can do with it.&#160; For instance,
            I'd love to have a real CVS server.&#160; (GDN workspaces only lets you check out
            one file at a time and SourceForge isn't very MS friendly...) I know someone else
            who (I think) is doing something similar to my co-op idea, but I don't want to "out"
            him.&#160; If anyone has experience doing this stuff, I'm all ears.&#160; This could&#160;
            become a pretty popular model for stepping up from a regular web hosting type account.</li>

        Instead of switching to a new ISP, I'm thinking of getting a bunch of friends together
        and buying a box and colocating it.&#160; Here is how the math works out: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1U server hosting: $100/mo.&#160; There are a couple places in seattle that i've found
            that offer this kind of deal.&#160; $100 seems to be the starting price. 
        </li>
        <li>
            1U server: ~$1200.&#160; This all depends on how much you want to spend.&#160; Since
            there won't be someone backing this stuff up for us, a RAID mirroring config is probably
            best.&#160; It looks like <a href="http://www.ironsystems.com/">iron systems</a> might
            have some decent machines.&#160; I spec'd out a 1.47GHz Athlon w/ 256MB of memory
            and 2 160GB disks w/ HW RAID for $1200. 
        </li>
        <li>
            OS: Install something free or step up to Windows 2k3 :)&#160; Being a MS employee,
            I can get a deal.&#160; This could be an extra $1000, depending.&#160; When the web
            edition is released it will probably be a lot cheaper. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        So, assuming that I can get 5 people together on this total, the start up cost will
        be $250-$450 each.&#160; The montly cost will be somewhere around $20 each.&#160;
        With 6 people, we can get the startup cost down to $200-$360 each.&#160; I'd probably
        want to charge more per month so that there is an ongoing slush fund for machine upgrades
        and fixes and such. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding SQL server is another $5k.&#160; Chances are I won't need anything that industrial
        strength.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, for a very reasonable price ($450 + $20/mo) you can get your very own W2k3 machine
        in a data center that you can do anything you want to.&#160; BTW, 160GB is a ton of
        disk space to have on the net.&#160; Beyond this, you also have to worry about back
        ups and applying the latest security patches... 
    </p>
    <p>
        Has anyone out there done this?&#160; How is it working out?&#160; Words of advice?

        I finally cleaned up my blogging software enough to release the source and an install
        package.&#160; There is a screenshot <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/05/03.html#a88">here</a>.
        I'm releasing this as 0.9.0.

        <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/JoeBlogger-src-0.9.0.zip">Source</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've installed the binaries, there is a readme on what to do next installed
        into the programs directory.&#160; You have to copy some stuff around and edit some
        xml files to configure what is going on.&#160; If any of this is unclear, let me know
        and I'll update the readme.&#160; The readme is <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger/Readme-0.9.0.txt">here</a> also. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the basic architecture: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All data exists in <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger</code>.&#160; If you want
            to back up your site, this is the thing to back up. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Config/Site1.Config</code> is a private config
            file with various file paths and FTP server information. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1</code> is everything that gets uploaded
            to the server.&#160; This includes the raw XML source data and the generated html
            files.&#160; If you have images or other files in that directory also, they will get
            uploaded for you. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1/Config/Site.Config</code> contains public
            config information. 
        </li>
        <li>
            When publishing the client generates the site into the <code>&lt;My Documents&gt;/JoeBlogger/Site1</code> dir
            and then uploads that to the FTP server. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Play around with it, send me any deltas you have and spread the word!

        I hate New York.&#160; It isn't just the Yankees.&#160; It is the snide attitude that
        nothing else matters.&#160; Dave Winer, today, has an <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/05/07#When:8:41:06PM">entry</a> today
        that smacks of the same self-righteousness:&#160; 
    </p>
    <blockquote>"Basically the rule is that success breeds envy, and envy isn't that far
    from hate." </blockquote> 
    <p>
        While I think that this sentiment is true, I think that the bigger reason that people
        hate him is that he is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=dsm+bipolar&amp;spell=1">Bipolar</a> whiner.
        I've never had an email exchange with him where he doesn't take his toys and go home.
    </p>
    <p>
        By Dave's own criteria, the only reason people hate Microsoft is because we are so
        successful.&#160; In the ancient <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews">essay</a> that
        he points to he makes this argument (with BillG) directly.&#160; However, he has changed
        his tune over the last couple of years.&#160; I'm pretty sure that he wouldn't write
        the same thing now.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "they only hate me because I'm successful" arguement may be some of why MS is
        such a focus for animosity, but I (and a lot of other people at Microsoft) think that
        the problem is deeper than that -- it is one of the ways the company has changed over
        the last couple of years.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        If Dave really beleives what he wrote, he is guilty of the same hubris of which he
        accuses us.

        It is getting on to time for me to look for a new car.&#160; I was pretty settled

        Roadster</a> is looking pretty sweet.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking at picking it up sometime in September, but I want to plan ahead.&#160;
        I was going to avoid the 350Z Roadster because of the typical new car feeding frenzy
        but it looks like availability might not be that bad.&#160; However, if I get the
        Z4, I can pick it up in Spartanburg, NC.

      <div class="post">
        <p>

    <p>
        I was finally able to find time to put true WYSIWYG HTML editing into JoeBlogger.
        Here is a current screenshot:<br />
        <img src="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/JoeBlogger3.JPG" /> 
        <br />
        Notice that there is no save button.&#160; Just start a new entry and hit Upload.&#160;
        It FTPs everything that has changed to your site on a background thread. If you don't
        hit upload, it will automatically save your unpublished entry.&#160; I really like
        the UI model with no explicit "save" functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        I stole the HTML editing control code (which is really a wrapper around IE's rendering
        engine: Trident) from <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn's</a> <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=ddc98753-6559-489b-a533-57034790a93a">BlogX</a>.&#160;
        He stole it from Nikhil Kothari&#160;who wrote it originally&#160;<a href="http://www.asp.net">ASP.NET</a> <a href="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/default.aspx?tabindex=4&amp;tabid=46">WebMatrix</a> project.&#160;
        The HTML -&gt; XHTML conversion code was written by Andrew Lin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that JoeBlogger is a very different project than BlogX.&#160; BlogX is a client/server
        solution that has the canonical data store on the server.&#160; It requires a ASP.Net
        server to run the server side part (Actually, you could probably write a different
        server that expose the same API, but you get the idea).&#160; JoeBlogger is a client
        side only solution that doesn't have <em>any</em> server side code at all.&#160; All
        of the pages are generated on the client and uploaded to the server.&#160; As long
        as you have FTP access to your web server (and almost everyone does) you are set. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are interested in getting&#160;a look at the JoeBlogger source, let me know
        and I can give you an early drop of the source.&#160; I'll probably add some more
        features (and a decent setup) and then release it.

        to get a bunch of friends together and colocate a box? Most places look like they
        really rip you on extra storage space. If I can't find anything good then I may drop
        the ASP.Net requirement and do most everything client side and FTP static pages up
        like I'm doing now.

        Version 0.9.0 of my upstreamer is released.

        The source is available <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/FTPUpstreamer/FTPUpstreamer-0.9.0.zip">here</a>.
        The license for both is a zlib type license. You can read it <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/FTPUpstreamer/License.txt">here</a>.

    <p>
        Notes about the release: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            FTPUpstreamer is a utility to upload a local directory to a remote directory on an
            FTP server. It keeps track of the files that have been uploaded already and the last
            changed time on those files. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This is a beta release. Don't expect too much. I've only really tested this against
            one server (W2k3, I think). I've only tested the client on XP Pro. 
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no support for listing or deleting files on the server. If you want to do
            more sophisticated stuff you might want to check out a more fully featured FTP program.
            I've used <a href="http://www.smartftp.com/">SmartFTP</a> and it has worked well for
            me. 
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no support for automatic uploading yet. You have to hit the button. At some
            point I'll have it automatically scan for changes. I'll also make it minimize to a
            tray icon. I figured getting something out early is best. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The program requires the .Net framework v1.0. You can get this from Windows Update. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Your FTP password is stored in plain text.</b> The config file is something like
            "c:\Documents and Settings\Joe\Local Settings\Application Data\FTPUploadConfig.xml".
            I don't think the uninstaller removes this. There are some other data files in the
            same directory that will also not be removed. Buyer beware. 
        </li>
    </ul>

        If you have any problems go ahead and write me email at FTPUpstreamer at BedaFamily.com.
        If I'm not super responsive (I have a day job) you can always update the source yourself.
        If you send me deltas I'll try to integrate them. At some point I may put the source
        under some sort of project management like GotDotNet workspaces or Sourceforge.

      <div class="post">
        <p>
<p>I think I'm going to evolve my blogging software some more over the next couple of weeks.  I want to add the following features:
<ul>
<li>True WYSIWYG HTML editing.  I'm still writing HTML directly.  I think that I'm going to steal whatever Chris has in BlogX.
<li>Stories.  I want to be able to easily do one-off pages.
<li>Content macro expansion.  I want to be able to name a page or an entry and have a friendly way to refer to it.  Radio does this (I think) by just looking at words in quotes.  I may do the same.
<li>Photo gallery.  Ideally I'd like to be able to dump a bunch of files in a directory and have it create thumbnails and generate gallery pages.  I'd also want a UI for dealing with this stuff:  Ordering files, adding descriptions, etc.  I've been using <a href="http://www.pbase.com">PBase</a> for a while now but I think I want a better client side UI.
</ul>
<p>Right now the UI for JoeBlogger is dead simple.  There is no "save" button.  Just a "New Entry" and an "Upload" button.  There is a calendar control for finding entries and a list for all of the entries for that day.  My goal is to keep it that simple as I add these new features.
<p>BTW, I still plan on finishing the stand alone FTP uploader first!

It has a horizontal FOV of somewhere around 120 degrees.  Since this is a rectilinear projection, it is equivalent to shooting with a rectilinear 4mm lens.

    <p>
        Earlier tonight (I guess it is last night now...) I went and took a bunch of photos
        of the Idaho State Capital building here in Boise. I stitched these together using <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm">PTAssembler</a> (by
        Max Lyons) and <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/pano12ml.htm">PanoTools</a> (originally
        by <a href="http://www.fh-furtwangen.de/~dersch/">Helmut Dersch</a>). I think it came
        out pretty good for a first try. I think it would have come out better with a real
        pano tripod head instead of me just winging it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The full size image is around 11 megapixels. Each of those pixels is pretty sharp
        though. It has an amazing amount of detail:<br />

        [4/10/2004] I've realized that Capital should be Capitol, but you'd be surprised how
        many hits I get from the google search engine based on the misspelling.&#160; Oh well,
        I think I'll leave it wrong.

      <h2><a href="/post/old/00074.html">Cheap Pano Head</a></h2>
      <span class="lead">Mon, Apr 7, 2003</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>
<p>To make great panoramic pictures you need a panoramic head.  To make really great pictures you need a <i>spherical</i> panoramic head.  <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/">Max Lyons</a> and <a href="http://www.caldwellphotographic.com/MosaicTutorial.html>Brian Caldwell</a> both have examples of what can be done.  (Max says that he uses a homemade pano head with his Nikon 990, but I don't think that would work with my camera -- a Canon D60.)
<p>Unfortunately, spherical panoramic heads are, for some odd reason, very expensive.  Quality camera equipment, in general, is very very expensive, but these seem to be above and beyond.  For an example, check out <a href="http://www.kaidan.com/Detail.bok?no=44">this</a> product from Kaidan.  $740 is too much for me.
<p>I'm looking a constructing my own Pano head similar to what <a href="http://www.erik-krause.de/panohead/">Erik ruffle</a> has done.  I'm looking in to doing this with extruded aluminum "erector set" stock from <a href="http://www.erik-krause.de/panohead/">8020</a>.  I'm planning on mounting this on my <a href="http://www.acratech.net/prod01.htm">Acratech ball head</a>.  Like Erik, I plan on using the ball head upside down.  I've also purchased a Arca-swiss style quick release clamp from <a href="http://www.kirkphoto.com/platforms.html">Kirk Photo</a> to mount the camera.
<p>I'll post pictures if anything comes of this little project.

<ul><li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0399149864&itm=1">Pattern Recognition</a> by William Gibson.  Short review: Not nearly as good as nueromancer -- wait for the paperback.
<li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0394555090&itm=1">Theodore Rex</a> by Edmund Morris.  This is the followup to <u>The Rise of Theordore Roosevelt</u>.  After reading both of them, I think that the early life of Roosevelt is more interesting and dynamic.  The detailed description of his years in the whitehouse was something of an anticlimax.
<li>Book: <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0374528497&itm=1">The Metaphsycisal Club</a> by Louis Menand.  I just started this and it is heavy going.  However, I like it so far.  It isn't as dynamic (yet) as either of the Roosevent biographies.  I'll summerize after I finish it.
<li>Music: <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=696998641228">Scarlet's Walk</a> by Tori Amos.  This is some of her best stuff since Little Earthquakes.  
<li>Movie: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286499">Bend It Like Beckham</a>.  I saw this at the Idaho International Film Festival (Bet you didn't know that Idaho had a film festival) and I liked it a lot.  I thought it was clever with some hot women in it.  What's not to like?
<li>Movie: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0258068">The Quiet American</a>.  This 2002 remake of a 1958 film was very moving.  Starring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, it details a love triangle set in pre-US involvement Vietnam in the 50s.  Brendan Fraser is so hit or miss -- remember Monkeybone?
<li>Play: <a href="http://www.arbiteronline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/03/20/3e7920b2a19a6">Icarus</a> written by Edwin Sanchez and directed by Brian Weaver.  I enjoyed the play a lot -- I haven't been to a play in a while.  I thought the ending was a little bit of a let down.  It was very open ended.

<p>Now, for the tip of the day (or week, or whatever...)
<p>In debugging this latest problem, I had to download symbols for various OS components.  Internally, we have a pretty vast symbol server that can get you .PDBs for everything that you need.  Externally, you can get symbols for many components so that you can debug through them.  Nothing beats a good call stack!
<p>Both our internal and external systems use a <i>symbol server</i> to locate the right symbols.  We didn't have this until ~2 years ago, and I don't know how we lived without it.  Getting the right symbols used to be voodoo -- now it is super easy.

<p>I've gotten some nibbles from at least 4 people on the upstreamer.  That isn't all 7 of you out there but I guess this will do :)
<p>I'll start on it this weekend or sometime early next week.  Hopefully it will go fast as I already have the FTP code.
<p><a href="http://gary.burd.info">Gary Burd</a> suggested a combo of ssh, rsync and a crontab entry. It looks like you can <a href="http://optics.ph.unimelb.edu.au/help/rsync/">install RSync on windows</a> if you try hard enough. However, I don't have that much control over all of the machines that I want to upload to, so this looks like a non-starter -- at least for me.  Getting a more secure connection would be nice, though.
<p>I also was thinking about taking advantage of the shadow copy stuff in XP but it looks like you need to sign an NDA to get at that SDK.  Oh well.

<P>I want to gauge interest in a new project.  How many of you out there (and I know there are something like 7 of you :) would actually use a utility that did the following:
<ul><li>Had a list of local directories and FTP servers/paths
<li>Monitored those dirs (timer or file change notifications) for changes.
<li>Upstream new files (based on file times) to the FTP server.  This wouldn't be a full sync but would rather be a copy.  It would never delete anything from the server.
<li>Has a tray icon to let you know what is going on.
</ul>

<P>BTW, this is a feature stolen almost verbatim from Radio.  I think that it would be useful to break it out into its own utility.

<P>The real reason I would want this is that frickin' VS.Net doesn't have a way to deply an ASP.Net application to an FTP server.  You can copy it or use FP extentions, but you can't FTP that guy up there.

<P>I would include source and an installer for this guy.
<P>If you are interested, email me at <a href="mailto:eightypercent at bedafamily.com">eightypercent at bedafamily.com</a> and I'll think about putting something together.

<p><a href="http://ocw.abf.tulane.edu/blog/">Jorge Curioso</a> <a href="http://ocw.abf.tulane.edu/blog/?item=63182667125303">posted on his blog</a> some comments around dealing with dates in RSS and the .Net framework.  I figure I'd put some more detail up here on how I handle dates in JoeBlogger.
<ol>
<li>I store both GMT and local time when creating an entry.  I should probably keep a "last updated" time too but I haven't done that yet.  From these two you can either output absolute time (for RSS) or you can output local time so that everyone can know your state of mind when you made that post.  It makes a difference if you are posting at 5 am in the morning vs. 10 am.
<li>I used C# to do all of my date processing.  Here is the code for my properites for these things:
<pre>
        // The PubDate here is in universal time -- UTC
        [XmlIgnore]
        public DateTime PubDate;

        [XmlElement(ElementName="PubDate")]
        public string PubDateString

<li>Finially, I do all of the massaging from these times into my display times in the stylesheet itself.  <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/stuff/SourceExample.xml">Here</a> is an example of a source XML document for my main page and <a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/templates/Main.xslt">here</a> is my XSLT template for transforming that.  If you can assume the .Net implementation of XSLT, you can use some MS specific extensions like this:
<pre>
    &lt;msxsl:script implements-prefix='user' language='CSharp'&gt;
        &lt;![CDATA[
        public string FormatTime(string input)
        {
            DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact(input, "ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH':'mm':'ss", null);
            return dt.ToString("h':'mm':'ss tt");
        }
        public string FormatArchiveLink(string input)
        {
            DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact(input, "ddd, dd MMM yyyy HH':'mm':'ss", null);
            return String.Format(@"/Archive/{0:D4}/{1:D2}/{2:D2}.html", dt.Date.Year, dt.Date.Month, dt.Date.Day);
        }
        ]]&gt;
    &lt;/msxsl:script&gt;
</pre>
And then use that in the output like this:
<pre>
&lt;xsl:value-of select="user:FormatTime(LocalPubDate)"/&gt;
</pre>
</ol>

<p>It might be a good thing if we someone came up with a namespaced extension for RSS to speicfy local time along with GMT.  Having "First published" and "Last changed" times might be interesting also.  Perhaps I'll write something up at some point.

Okay, Chris, what <i>do</i> you want in the FTP upstreamer?  I don't think that Radio's upstreamer deletes either.  Here is what I can do easily:
<ul>
<li>CD to a directory.  Throw if the dir isn't there.
<li>[done] Ensure a directory.  Try my best to make sure that a directory (and the path up to it) exists.
<li>Delete a directory.  The server will probably return an error if there are files in it.  I will throw.
<li>Get the current directory.
<li>Move up a direcotry.
<li>[done] Upload a file into the current directory.
<li>Download a file in the current directory and return a stream.  It would be easiest to buffer the entire file in memory.
<li>Delete a file in the current directory.
<li>[done] Return a text string with the current directory listing.
<li>Call SYST and return whatever the system gives us.  This might help detect the type of system on the other end.
</ul>
<p>The only thing that isn't easy and that will probably take quite a while to get right is parsing the output of the directory listing.  I don't have a bunch of servers to test this against to make sure it will work.
<p>As for the upstreamer itself, I'd rather have it not try and sync the stuff on the server (and hence delete stuff) because I'd be afraid of loosing data.  For instance, I upstream into the root of my site and I have all sorts of subdirs off of that.  I'm setting up a weblog for Rachel on eightypercent.net and her root will be a subdir.  I don't want to clobber her stuff whenever I upload my site.

<P>I coded up non passive FTP support for my FTP code.  It only took me ~30 mins.  I've handed that off to Chris so perhaps it will show up in BlogX at some point.  If not, I may write a standalone utility and release that.
<P>It was pretty easy to send the PORT command and start accepting connections.  I had to mess around a little bit to get it right so I wish that the documentation around using sockets was better.  For instance, there is no short sample that shows creating a socket, binding it to an address and then accepting connections.
<P>BTW, my router (Linksys wireless/4 port) works with both passive and regular FTP connections.  It must be monitoring the control connection and (a) rewriting it with the public FTP address and (b) opening the port through to my machine.  These little boxes are just amazing.

      <span class="lead">Thu, Feb 27, 2003</span>
      <div class="post">
        <p>
<P>My FTP code only supports PASV ftp right now.  The reasoning is that I'm behind a NAT firewall and my server isn't.  PASV works much better in that configuration.  <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/063d639b-10c7-4826-9f5f-0b6c026a9268">Chris is having problems</a> getting my code to work and he is blaming this.
<P>FTP generally has two TCP connections:  a control connection and a data connection.  The control connection is pretty straigtforward.  You connect to port 21 and start sending messages back and forth.  Some of these commands ask to open a data connection -- to upload a file, download a file or get a directory listing.
<P>There are two ways to establish the data connection:
<ol><li><B>Normal FTP</B>: you can have the server establish the connection to your machine.  You tell the server that you are listening on a certain port and that he should connect to you there.
<li><B>Passive FTP</B>: you establish the connection to the server.  You ask the server for another address/port and you initiate the connection.
</ol>  
<p>In a world with network address translation (NAT) it is a lot easier to connect from your protected machine out to the network than it is to have another machine connect (on a new port) to you.  This is why I did passive FTP.  Doing normal FTP shouldn't be that hard if this is indeed the problem that Chris is having.
<p>Oh yeah, and if both client and server are behind NAT, you are screwed.  That is unless one of the NATs is smart enough to understand FTP and translate stuff along the way.  HTTP can work better here since everyone understands it and it all happens on one socket.  However, HTTP servers aren't set up for this type of thing without wacky extensions like WebDAV or the frontpage extensions.

<p><a href="http://michaelw.net">Michael Winser</a> suggested that I should think about taking the same approach that citydesk uses.  They do two things differently than Radio:
<ul>
<li>They use a CRC instead of a byte for byte comparison.  Apparently they use this instead of filetimes altogether.  I could compute the CRC (or do the comparison with the file on disk too, I guess) by wrapping the stream that the transform is writing to and doing the CRC/comparison on the fly
<li>They also post a list of files and CRCs as an xml file on the server. This makes it easier to synchronize files across machines
</ul>

<p>I definitely want to enable the cross machine case, and file times do seem a little fragile to me.  This is something I'll have to think about a little more.
<p>Two way synchronization is really hard though?  What happens if the same file changes on both the client and the server?  How do you handle deleting a file?  (Do you care about deleting a file?)
<p>Another problem comes up when you have multi-party authoring and syncing and that is with respect to item numbers.  Right now I have an item number count that I store in a config file and update every time I create a new entry (it is currently at 49).  <a href="http://simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> solves this problem with a good old fashion GUID (I have a bunch cheap if you need them ;)  I might be able to switch over without killing my RSS feed and perma links if I just treat the item ID as a string.

<p>I have the "comparison before saving" stuff working and that is cutting down my upload times dramatically.  This is almost like a real blogging tool now.  However, one function -- called TransformAndSaveDoc -- turned out really nasty.  This function transforms an xml document with an xslt style sheet.  It then compares the result to what is already on disk and only writes the new result to disk if the new version is different from the old version.
<p>Suggestions for making this tighter?  Is there some functionality (memcmp?) that I'm missing in the .Net framework?

<p>I have the dictionary done so now I don't upload files that haven't changed.  Now all I have to do is change my generation code so that it doesn't actually write to files that haven't changed.
<p>I could do this by making sure that I track which data files have changed and figuring out which output files that means that I have to generate.
<p>Or, I could just always generate every output file, but compare it to what is on disk before writing it.  If it is exactly the same as what is already there, I can just throw away my in memory copy and not write anything.
<p>Radio took the first approach, except it didn't get it completely right.  If you added a new entry in Radio, it wouldn't update any of the archive pages.  The problem is that you would always see links going further back on the calendar but never going forward, as it would never update one of the archive pages.  With the second approach it may take a little longer to generate the site,  but you'll be sure to update everything that needs to be updated.
<p>I think that I'm going to go with the second approach.  I can adapt and implement the first as needed (perhaps on a more granular level.

<P>I also need to do the uploading on a different thread and report status.

<P>I got mail from <a href="http://gary.burd.info/">Gary Burd</a> that my RSS feed was valid.  The problem was that I was using relative URLs in some of my entries.  I've fixed up the problem and I'll be sure to keep an eye on that in the future.

<P><a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx?guid=b6b07998-429a-4bbf-a49e-8fa7f9af4a30">Chris</a> recommends <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=68CELOCOM7&isbn=0375756787&itm=1">The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt</a>.  I'm reading this right now and probably about 3/4 of the way done.  I'm also amazed at the productivity and veriety of experiences this man had at so young an age.  It really drives me to get off of my ass and do something.
<P>A few weeks ago I finished <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=68CELOCOM7&isbn=0385495404&itm=1">The First American</a> by H. W. Brands.  This is a biography of Benjamin Franklin.  I'd also highly recommend it.  Again, this is someone who went out and created his own destiny.
<P>In reading these two back to back, you can't help but see the contrasts.  Roosevelt was the jock intellectual, Franklin was the geek of his time.
<P>I love american history.  In college I took quite a few courses on 20th century american history.  In the last couple of years I've started reaching back a little further.  It is just so amazing to me to make the connection between now and say, 100 years ago.  When you start reading these histories, time tends to compress and a century is a lot closer than it appears.  Hell, a little over <S>100</S>150 years ago we were invading Mexico (Mexican/American War).

<P>I think that I'm done for tonight.  Next I'm going to work on an FTP upstreamer so that I can just hit a button (or work it on a timer/file system change notification) to upload the site instead of using <a href="http://www.smartftp.com">SmartFTP</a> to upload manually.

<P><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/02/08">Doc</a> had his laptop stolen.  This is something that I worry about all of the time. However, I think that I have things set so that I wouldn't skip a beat if my laptop was gone.  All of my files are shared between many programs using My Documents redirection.  This server that these files are stored on is maintained by the MS IT department and is backed up by them.  I use offline files  to cache those files locally when I'm not connected.  On top of that I checked the checkbox (it is that easy) to make my offline files encrypted.  That way I don't worry about someone getting ahold of trade secrets either.
<P>In fact, I recently just upgraded the hard drive on my laptop (to a sweet 60GB) and did a reinstall while I was at it.  No problems and no data lost.

<P>I now store the local time and GMT with each entry.  This seems to me to be the right way to do this.  The RSS feed is always GMT, but really, when you read a weblog, you want to know the local time when that was written.  It really puts it in context.
<P>This means that the entries on my weblog before the 5th are in PST and those after the 5th are in MST.  I wish there were standard ways to name timezones but that all seems a little tricky.
<P>With my current solution I can still keep all of my data in day based XML files.  I'm just clear that an entry gets slotted into a particular file based on the local time when it was written.

<P>ChrisAn <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/2003/02/06.html#a167">says</a> that I need to support permalinks.  This is part of the plan but I need to renumber my entries (as I have duplicates now!) and I want to think long and hard about what I want my permalinks to be.  I'd also like to do this only once so that I don't spam everyone using Syndirella or other RSS aggregators as my feed completely changes.
<P>Ideally I'd like to create a page per day or per week and have the permalink point into that.  However, I don't want to break links around midnight as I move back to Seattle at some point.  I think that I'm going to start storing a time zone with each of my entries and use that to adjust when figuring out which entries go in which days.  
<P>In some ways this would be easier with a server side solution as I would just have an archive page that takes the entry number as a parameter.  There are other advantages to the client side solution though.

<LI>Deleting and other such management of an entry
<LI>Categories!
<LI>Work on my template to improve the look of my site
<LI>Multiple site management and site configuration.  A lot of stuff is hard coded right now.
</UL>
<P>I've also decided that storing the entries in an xml file per day is a bad idea.  The timezones will get you.  I store the timestamp on an entry using GMT but the XML file (which is used as input into the UI) is based on local time.  I also use localtime all over the place in the UI.  I'll probably move to a flat list of entries (one per XML file) at some point and just figure out the local day assignments at runtime.  This will map much better to a real database anyway.</P>

Note that this will always be an in memory XmlDocument and will probably never be persisted, except for debugging purposes.&nbsp; Here is what a source doc might look like:</P><PRE>&lt;JoeBloggerData&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;EveryPage&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;File name="Bloglist.xml"&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... verbatim paste of bloglist.xml here<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/File&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... same for every file in the EveryPage dir<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/EveryDay&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Days&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Day date="Sun, 26 Jan 2003"&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... verbatim paste of 2003/01/26.xml here<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Day&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... every day relevant to this page.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Days&gt;<BR>&lt;/JoeBloggerData&gt;</PRE>
    <P>Generating a page is now the simple matter of writting an XSL stylesheet that takes this source document and produces the correct output doc.<BR></P>

<P>Okay, here is the deal.&nbsp; My weblogging software will be similar to Radio in the breakdown of client server, at least to start with.&nbsp; The client will do all of the page generation and formatting and then upload the result to the server.&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, there is still the problem where you then have one and only one computer that can produce entries.&nbsp; I say we solve this by uploading the raw data and templates up to the server too.&nbsp; Hell, it is just xml, right?&nbsp; It will take a little more room on the server but you get these advantages:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Can sync any new client to the state that is currently on the server 
<LI>Easy to move between servers 
<LI>Automatic data backup 
<LI>Can transition to a client/server solution and just upload the data and have the processing happen on the server</LI></UL>
<P>I think this will work out nicely.&nbsp; Here is my plan of attack:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Write a simple XML-&gt;HTML templating engine.&nbsp; I'll probably just base this on XSLT.&nbsp; The input document will have all of the interesting stuff in it.&nbsp; I'll make that source&nbsp;XML tree&nbsp;extensible (via enumerating the file system) so that you can create XML in any way you want (current favorite song, blog roll, etc) and have that included in any interesting page.&nbsp; RSS will be a part of this from the start.
<LI>Write a simple GUI to generate XML for various entries.&nbsp; This will have one button generation of the site.
<LI>Integrate FTP support.&nbsp; I've been looking at how to do this and I don't think it will be&nbsp;too hard.&nbsp; I think that I'm only going to support passive mode.&nbsp; It would be nice if the .Net framework provide some FTP libraries out of the box.
<LI>Make the FTP support smarter so that it only uploads as needed.
<LI>Add more features like the calandar that Radio produces.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll have a ton ideas once I get started.</LI></OL>
<P>I have 13 days left on my Radio free trial so I have this weekend and next weekend to get it to a stage where I can stop using radio.&nbsp; I'll also have to write a importer from Radio for the few entries that I have so far.</P>

        limiting, but I was able to make it work.&#160; Here is the data you need (save the
