<p>I think I'm going to evolve my blogging software some more over the next couple of weeks.  I want to add the following features:
<ul>
<li>True WYSIWYG HTML editing.  I'm still writing HTML directly.  I think that I'm going to steal whatever Chris has in BlogX.
<li>Stories.  I want to be able to easily do one-off pages.
<li>Content macro expansion.  I want to be able to name a page or an entry and have a friendly way to refer to it.  Radio does this (I think) by just looking at words in quotes.  I may do the same.
<li>Photo gallery.  Ideally I'd like to be able to dump a bunch of files in a directory and have it create thumbnails and generate gallery pages.  I'd also want a UI for dealing with this stuff:  Ordering files, adding descriptions, etc.  I've been using <a href="http://www.pbase.com">PBase</a> for a while now but I think I want a better client side UI.
</ul>
<p>Right now the UI for JoeBlogger is dead simple.  There is no "save" button.  Just a "New Entry" and an "Upload" button.  There is a calendar control for finding entries and a list for all of the entries for that day.  My goal is to keep it that simple as I add these new features.
<p>BTW, I still plan on finishing the stand alone FTP uploader first!

<p>Here is a panorama from Dante's View in Death Valley.  We made it up there for this spectacular sunset.  This is a stich of 6 images shot with my 20mm f/2.8 lens on my D60.  It has a horizontal FOV of somewhere around 120 degrees.  Since this is a rectilinear projection, it is equivalent to shooting with a rectilinear 4mm lens.

<p>I'm back from my photo trip to Death Valley.  I had a great time, got some great images and met some really interesting people.  I'll put up some of the images tonight after I finish wading through email at work!
<p>Since we woke up before sunrise every day (~4-5am) and stayed out after sunrise followed by dinner I didn't get much sleep.  I'm tired but also recharged.

<p>I'm still working on my <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/03/11.html#a66">FTP upstreamer</a> app.  I haven't had as much time as I'd have liked to work on it but it is still coming.  The backend code is all there but I haven't had the time to learn enough winforms to write a decent UI for it.  If you really want to look at the code (and itegrate it into your own project?) let me know and I'll send you something.  I'm release the code under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php">zlib</a> license like Chris did for BlogX.

<p>If you do write me, I probably won't get to it until next week as I'm going to be down in Death Valley for a <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/02/18.html#a39">photography</a> <a href="http://luminous-landscape.com/workshops/sk-dv-work.shtml">workshop</a>.

    <p>
        Earlier tonight (I guess it is last night now...) I went and took a bunch of photos
        of the Idaho State Capital building here in Boise. I stitched these together using <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm">PTAssembler</a> (by
        Max Lyons) and <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/maxlyons/pano12ml.htm">PanoTools</a> (originally
        by <a href="http://www.fh-furtwangen.de/~dersch/">Helmut Dersch</a>). I think it came
        out pretty good for a first try. I think it would have come out better with a real
        pano tripod head instead of me just winging it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The full size image is around 11 megapixels. Each of those pixels is pretty sharp
        though. It has an amazing amount of detail:<br />

    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a small 100% crop from the center of the frame to give you an idea of scale:<br />

    </p>
    <p>
        [4/10/2004] I've realized that Capital should be Capitol, but you'd be surprised how
        many hits I get from the google search engine based on the misspelling.&#160; Oh well,
        I think I'll leave it wrong.

<p>I was playing around with SharpReader and apparently I hit their server one too many times, as I'm now <a href="http://slashdot.org/faq/accounts.shtml#ac1050">banned</a> from the slashdot RSS feed.  Too funny -- I think I'll live.
<p>You can get banned from the front page too.  I've seen it happen at work when they mistook our proxy servers for someone hammering their machines.  They display a big red page.
