        I had a rant here wrt RSS history, but considering the fact that it really doesn't
        matter and it is always best to stay positive, I'll withold comment :).

        Dave Winer has a bug up his but to <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/04/06#When:6:58:43PM">try
        and claim</a> that he invented the idea of syndication through XML (embodied via the
        RSS format).&#160; I don't think that anyone will argue that Dave has been syndication's
        biggest evangelist and has driven his fork of the formats forward relentlessly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I just wish he wasn't such an ass.&#160; RSS (and syndication) like so many things
        in the computer world evolved out of a soup of ideas that stretches way back.&#160;
        Every time Dave <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rssVersionHistory">(re)writes
        a history of RSS</a>, he always lists himself as the original invetor and visionary.&#160;
        The particular history linked to above fails to mention a format that was introduced
        with IE 4 called CDF.&#160; This was <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/1997/2/">submitted
        to the W3C</a> at least 9 months before the earliest date on Dave's "history."&#160;
        Now, I'd also venture a guess that there are tons of other prior art in the soup that
        CDF came out of.&#160; For someone who rails against the patent system for the way
        it cements credit for ideas that come out of a soup (think Amazon 1-click) he does
        a good job of trying to "patent" RSS. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The really sad part here is that Dave does himself such a disservice.&#160; He has
        a huge bully pulpit that he could use to push his (often) very good ideas.&#160; Instead,
        he spends time trying to rewrite this particular history.&#160; He undercuts his own
        credibility in the process.&#160; Instead of being an elder statesman of the computer
        industry who can cut through the red tape, he sets himself up as a mini Napoleon and
        creates more divisiveness. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think this quote from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/">The Big Labowski</a>&#160;sums
        up my thoughts on the subject: 
    </p>
    <blockquote><b>Walter</b>: Am I wrong?<br />
    <b>Dude</b>: No you're not wrong.<br />
    <b>Walter</b>: Am I wrong?<br />
    <b>Dude</b>: You're not wrong Walter. You're just an asshole.<br />
    <b>Walter</b>: All right then. </blockquote>

        Never underestimate the throughput of a pigeon.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        While in New Zealand, we went on a caving trip that included a 100 meter abseil (rappel)
        into a cave and then climbed back out.&#160;&#160;One of&#160;the tour guides&#160;had
        a digital camera in a waterproof housing anchored to his harness.&#160; He took some
        pictures of us on the way down and when we got to the bottom.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The tour operator (<a href="http://www.waitomo.co.nz/">Waitomo Adventures</a>) wanted
        pictures from the adventrue to be ready by the time that we returned so that we could
        buy them.&#160; To do this they took&#160;the sony memory stick out of the camera
        and put in in to a little backpack on&#160;a carrier pigeon.&#160; They then let the
        pigeon go and yelled instructions to it on how to get back to the tour office.&#160;
        I think that the pigeon already knew the way, though.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we got back (a 20-25 minute trip in a van) the pigeon had arrived and the staff
        back at the office were busy printing out our pictures.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        We bought the pictures on CD also, but I don't have those with me right now.&#160;
        I'll post those soon so you can see the fruit of the little pigeon's labor.

        <h2><a href="/post/old/00172.html">DIY Home Theater Screen</a></h2>
        <span class="lead">Wed, Mar 24, 2004</span>
        <div class="post">
          <p>

    <p>
        Somebody named Cash posted a comment asking about my DIY HT Screen.&#160; Here is
        what I did: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Built a 2"x4" frame the size of my screen.&#160; It is a simple rectangle with a supporting
            member in the middle.&#160; I used some screws and metal "fasteners" to make all of
            the right angles. 
        </li>
        <li>
            A friend came over and helped me mount it to the wall.&#160; I did this by securing
            a 2"x4" in to studs in the wall.&#160; I then put small blocks screwed to the back
            of my frame.&#160; The small blocks were then set on top of the 2"x4" on the wall
            and shimmed until the frame was level on the wall.&#160; I also put some blocks of
            wood in the bottom corners to support the bottom. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the frame was level and where I wanted it on the wall I screwed it in to the
            2"x4" that was already attached to the wall. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then put a piece of hardboard (cut by Home Depot) on top of the frame.&#160; This
            is essentially pegboard without the holes.&#160; It is smooth enough and works pretty
            well.&#160; I screwed this around the edges. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then primed and painted the hardboard screen.&#160; 2 coats of primer and 2 coats
            of matte "Misty Evening."&#160; This is a color suggested by <a href="http://avsforum.com">avsforum.com</a>.&#160;
            I used a small can of "Evermore Interior Latex Flat" paint.&#160; The label has code
            "30BG 64/036" next to the Misty Evening name, if that helps.&#160; This was all applied
            with a very fine roller and let dry. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I then built a mitered frame out of good quality (no warping) 1"x4"s.&#160;&#160;We
            wrapped these in black material&#160; and stapled it on the back.&#160; I used black
            felt, but I think that black velvet would be better if you can find a cheap source.&#160;
            I then used finish nails to secure this around the edge of the screen and hide all
            of the screw heads.&#160; I punched the nails in and they are now hidden&#160;behind
            the fabric. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The result is probably overbuilt and not as great as a grayhawk screen, but the price
        can't be beat and it looks pretty darn professional.&#160; The black border really
        helps. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me know if you have any questions or want any pictures!&#160; I don't want to
        take it apart or anything :)

        to light up regular old photo paper that is developed in traditional chemistry.&#160;
        The whole thing is color profile savvy so you can be sure that you'll at least get
        within spitting distance of good color.&#160; I've done prints with them before and

        We are going to get to Auckland, pick up our car rental and then wing it.&#160; I

        I don't know how many people care, but I'm sorry that I haven't been posting lately!&#160;
        I'll try to make that up some.&#160; Anyway, here is an update of what has been happening: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Went to Cabo San Lucas for a week and relaxed.&#160; It was great to sit in the sun
            at the beach, order a bucket of beers and eat tacos. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Adopted two dogs.&#160; Their names are Lady and Cocoa.&#160; Lady is one and a half
            years old and was rescued from a meth lab and was probably abused.&#160; She hasn't
            shown many signs of it, but you never know what is going to trigger memories of abuse.&#160;
            She had a litter of puppies when she was really young.&#160; Cocoa is the one puppy
            for which the rescuers didn't find a home.&#160; He was her favorite puppy, so we
            adopted them as a pair.&#160; More details and pictures to come later. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I celebrated the one year anniversary of my blog by not posting.&#160; You can find
            the first post <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/01/09.html">here</a> from
            Janurary 9, 2003. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Read lots and lots of books.&#160; I've been reading ebooks on my PocketPC on the
            bus to and from work every day.&#160; I love ebooks! 
        </li>
        <li>
            Started writing some ASP.Net code for a picture gallery over at bedafamily.com.&#160;
            I'd love to finish this up so that I can easily post lots of photos.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I've started recovering from the hibernation that is winter in Seattle.&#160; I want
        to start talking more about what is going on in Avalon and life in general.
