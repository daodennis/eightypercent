        The house stuff is winding down.&#160; We close on August 18th, and I think that we
        are mostly on cruise control until then.&#160; We needed the owners to put a new roof
        on the house, so there was quite a bit of back and forth on that.&#160; I think we
        have it worked out now!

        In any case, this last weekend I went to my <a href="http://www.imsa93.org/">10 year
        high school</a> reunion.&#160; It was a blast!&#160; I should put some pictures up...

        (The reasons that I don't post any pictures is that I want to make JoeBlogger have
        a picture gallery mode and I haven't gotten around to coding it up yet.&#160; I should
        really get off my ass and do it.)
