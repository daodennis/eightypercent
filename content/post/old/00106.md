    <p>
        I've been working on buying a new car recently.&#160; I'm going to buy a BMW Z4.&#160;
        As part of this I've started learning as much as I can so that I pick the right options
        (and the right car!) and get a good deal.&#160; As part of this I've been reading
        the <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/">online forums</a> up at roadfly.

        BMW seems to have great customer service!&#160; Check out <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/forum.php?postid=3341488&amp;page=1">this</a> thread.&#160;
        This guy is having problems with the SMG transmission on his car.&#160; (SMG is "Sequential
        Manual Gearbox" and is similar to an F1 race car transmission)&#160; Notice <a href="http://bimmer.roadfly.org/bmw/forums/e85/forum.php?postid=3350545&amp;page=1">this</a> response
        from a BMW customer service rep.

        I wish that we could give this type of support for Windows.&#160; Perhaps if we charged
        $40k a copy we could :)
