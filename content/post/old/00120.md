    <p>
        I'm back in Seattle for good!&#160; Yay! 
    </p>
    <p>
        On top of that, Rachel and I took this week off to move and buy a house.&#160; We've
        made an offer and they have accepted!&#160; The inspection is on Sunday and we are
        figuring out mortgage and insurance stuff.&#160; The house is in the <a href="http://montlake.net/montlake.asp">Montlake</a> neighborhood
        of Seattle.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        The house is withing walking distance to the University hospital so, Rachel can walk
        to work most of the time.&#160; The rest of the time there are free shuttles that
        run from the U hospital to the other hospitals around Seattle.&#160; The house is
        also close enough to the freeway bus stop so I can stop sitting in my car and start
        sitting in a bus.&#160; Microsoft has a really good bus commuter program where anyone
        can get a free bus pass. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, in <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">great historic tradition</a>&#160;I may
        get busy with the house, the move and work and I may not be posting much.
