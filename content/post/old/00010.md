<P>Again, I'm answering Michael's <A href="http://michaelw.net/Articles/Itsmorethanjustpostingvia.html">posts</A> up here -- it is probably better then sending him email or IMing him.&nbsp; If you want to collected related links, there are couple of ways to do it -- one is a system of <A href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback">pingbacks</A> or <A href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_trackback.html#reference%20documentation">trackback</A> (which I haven't wrapped my head around yet) and the other is to look at your <A href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/20.html#automatic_linkbacks">referrer logs</A>&nbsp;[diveintomark.org].</P>
<P>Apparently, the great thing about standards is that there are so many.</P>
