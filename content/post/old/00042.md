<P><a href="http://www.jelovic.com/weblog/index.htm">Dejan Jelovic</a> sent me some mail pointing to his <a href="http://www.jelovic.com/ftplib/">managed wrapper on wininet</a>.
<P>This looks pretty cool and wininet is pretty well tested, if a little quirky.  However, I think that I'm going to do my own thing just for the sake of doing it.  <a href="http://michaelw.net/Articles/Whywere-inventtheweblogwh.html">I'm having fun</a> with the little victories of doing something pretty fundamental from the ground up.
