        Reiner Fink (old buddy and probably responsible for some of the <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/15/71552/7795">more
        interesting comments</a> in the NT source) sent me a link to the <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/how_to/the_nonexpert_ikea.php">IKEA
        Walkthrough</a>: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>IKEA is a fully immersive, 3D environmental adventure that allows you
    to role-play the character of someone who gives a shit about home furnishings. In
    traversing IKEA, you will experience a meticulously detailed alternate reality filled
    with garish colors, clear-lacquered birch veneer, and a host of NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS
    (NPCs) with the glazed looks of the recently anesthetized. </blockquote>
