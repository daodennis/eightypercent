        I'm having a blast in New Zealand.&#160; We've been touring around by car and doing
        some amazing things.&#160; The highlight so far was a 100m abseil (what they call
        rappelling down here) into a cave and then climbing back out.

        I've also gotten some great images.&#160; Here are some thumbnails:

        (I think that setting the timezone on my laptop exposed some timezone bugs in my blogging
        engine as it is publishing everything!)
