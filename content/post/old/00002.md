<P>I was having a conversation about this stuff with Michael Winser (when are you going to start one of these blog thingys?).&nbsp; He is a happy user of <A href="http://www.vonage.com">Vonage</A> and is working on trying out some of the other services.&nbsp; His comment was that these VoIP solutions will be too successful and the phone companies will try to regulate them out of business.</P>
