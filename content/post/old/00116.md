        Apparently, man <em>cannot</em> live (long) by bread alone, according to <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_209.html">this
        Straight Dope column</a> from 1978 (and it's online!).&#160; However, do you think

        Chip Peanut Crunch Clif Bars</a> and <a href="http://www.dietcoke.com/the_line_up.shtml#dietcoke">Diet
        Code</a>?
