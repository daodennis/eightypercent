        This was a pretty lean day on the workshop.&#160; This was our day to go and hike
        out to "the wave."&#160; The Wave is a really cool set of sandstone rock formations
        buried in the north part of <a href="http://www.az.blm.gov/paria/cbusereg2.html">Coyote
        Buttes</a>.&#160; A permit is required to hike Coyote Buttes and the BLM restricts
        it to 10 people per day.&#160; The problem is that on the weather had taken a turn
        for the worse during the night.&#160; When we work up at 5 AM on Sunday, it was raining
        in page.&#160; As we drove toward the trailhead we gained elevation and it started
        snowing.&#160; Around 6 AM we needed to start driving on gravel roads.&#160; It was
        still snowing pretty hard and we decided to turn back.&#160; I was looking forward
        to a good hike and was disappointed that we didn't make it to the Wave.

        When we got back to the motel, we picked up everyone else and went "hunting."&#160;
        Off the side of the road outside of Page, as we were climbing, we stopped to photograph
        some fresh snow on desert trees.&#160; This is one of the images that resulted.

        Technical details: Original composition was 24 images (8x3).&#160; I cropped out just
        a corner of that to make the composition as seen above.&#160; Total images used then
        is probably more like 15 (5x3).&#160; Each was shot at 1/25 sec, f/11, ISO 100 with
        the 24-70 f/2.8L @ 50mm.&#160; Final image is 6000x6000 or 36 megapixel.
