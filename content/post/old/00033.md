<P><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/02/08">Doc</a> had his laptop stolen.  This is something that I worry about all of the time. However, I think that I have things set so that I wouldn't skip a beat if my laptop was gone.  All of my files are shared between many programs using My Documents redirection.  This server that these files are stored on is maintained by the MS IT department and is backed up by them.  I use offline files  to cache those files locally when I'm not connected.  On top of that I checked the checkbox (it is that easy) to make my offline files encrypted.  That way I don't worry about someone getting ahold of trade secrets either.
<P>In fact, I recently just upgraded the hard drive on my laptop (to a sweet 60GB) and did a reinstall while I was at it.  No problems and no data lost.
