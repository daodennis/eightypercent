        <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cumpsd/archive/2004/02/22/78076.aspx">David Cumps</a> is
        playing around with XAML and skewing UI controls.&#160; He found a bug which causes
        some rendering artifacts when doing a skew of a listbox.&#160; I tried some of his
        XAML out on the latest and greatest bits and didn't find the bug.&#160; So, this is
        either a video driver issue, or it is something that we've fixed since the PDC.&#160;
        Here is a (badly encoded -- thanks mspaint.exe) gif of a skewed list box:
