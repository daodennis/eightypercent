        You have to own a guinea pig to appreciate <a href="http://www.snapple.com/bull/">this</a>.&#160;
        Make sure you actually wait and watch the ad.&#160; <a href="http://www.snapple.com/bull/movies/ad_H.wmv">Here</a> is
        a direct link to the ad video file in wmv format (other formats are available on the
        site).

        (Getting that snapshot of the video was a total PITA.&#160; Because of video overlays,
        PrintScreen didn't work.&#160; I had to turn off all of the video acceleration features
        via the display control panel so that the video went through the normal display pipeline.&#160;
        Overlays suck -- and they don't work with a desktop compositor.&#160; <em>Hint, hint</em>.)
