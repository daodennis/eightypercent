    <p>
        I'm trying out putting some Google Ads on my web page.&#160; Mostly this is an experiment
        but I wouldn't mind something to offset the (pretty low already) cost of hosting this
        site.&#160; It looks like the first batch of ads are all about seattle driving school
        and legal help.&#160; Apparently my entry on traffic court in Seattle is what the
        ad algorithm keyed in on.
