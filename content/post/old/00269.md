    <p>
        Scott Ludwig and I have released a new version of&#160;his python based backup script,
        Link-Backup.&#160; This new version ignores broken symlinks and has an option to ensure
        that only one backup at a time is going on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also with this release is a cgi script (viewlb.cgi) for exploring the backups.&#160;
        This makes it easy to keep tabs on what is going on.&#160; Scott wrote this script
        a while ago and I updated and improved it.
