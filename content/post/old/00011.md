<P>So I was doing a very narcissistic thing and looking up my name on google.&nbsp; I found a super early <A href="http://www.forbesfield.com/old-guests.html">post</A> to a grafitti board.&nbsp; This dates back to 1994.&nbsp; However, I know that I had a computer up and running on the internet at least in my junior year of high school -- 91-92.&nbsp; It is amazing to think that I've been living with the internet for over 10 years now.</P>
<P>When I first started working on IE, I jokingly told people that "this whole internet thing would blow over."&nbsp; Well, it did and it didn't.</P>
