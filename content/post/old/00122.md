    Just to give Scoble some <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/18.html#a3852">back
    up</a>.&#160; I'm planning on being at the PDC.&#160; If you are there and want to
    talk about the new Graphics APIs, I'm one of the guys to find.&#160; If I don't end
    up presenting a session or two you can be sure that I worked hard on the slide decks.
