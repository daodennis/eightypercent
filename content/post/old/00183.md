        Ha! I get linked from a <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=106586&amp;cid=9070786">comment</a> and
        I see a spike in traffic.&#160; Slashdot is <em>the</em> flow machine.&#160; In any
        case, there are some misstatements in that comment that I'd like to answer.&#160;
        First, I'm not "the guy from Microsoft behind Avalon."&#160; Rather I'm one on a large
        team of developers.&#160; My particular area is the graphics APIs.&#160; Avalon is
        much more than just graphics.

        Second, managed code is a different beast that unmanaged code.&#160; While it can
        make programmers more productive and I totally think that it is the way of the future,
        a developer can write bad code in any language.&#160; While right now I don't think
        that anyone would claim that managed code is faster than unmanaged code, the difference
        is generally not that great.&#160; I've heard of some research that suggests that
        future JITs may be able to apply run time directed optimizations and recompilation
        that <em>could</em> make managed code faster.&#160; But that world isn't here yet.
