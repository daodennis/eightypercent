    out the trailer for <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/pqtrailer.html">Peasant's Quest</a>!
    You are Rather Dashing, a peasant whose life is destroyed when Trogdor, the Burinator,
    destroys your thatched hut.&#160; How much would you pay for this game?&#160; <s>$100</s>?&#160;<s>$50</s>? <s>$0.50</s>?&#160;
    Don't spend any money because it is <em><a href="http://homestarrunner.com/disk4of12.html">free</a>. </em>See
    if you can complete it with all 150 points!&#160; I was able to finish the game on
    my own but couldn't get all of the points without finding a walkthrough.
