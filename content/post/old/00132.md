    <p>
        Well, I'm moved in to my new house.&#160; The DSL is hooked up and we are starting
        to unpack.

        I need to change the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/I/ICBM-address.html">ICBM</a> coords
        for <a href="http://www.geourl.com">geourl</a>, along with 10 thousand other things
        to do when starting out in a new house!
