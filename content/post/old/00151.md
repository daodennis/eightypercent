    <p>
        There are some questions that have been coming up pretty often, so I want to put together
        a series of posts addressing these.&#160; I don't have time to do this now, but I
        wanted to pull together the questions.&#160; Here is what I have so far?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            SVG vs. XAML?&#160; What up with that?&#160; Why are you guys different?&#160; How
            can I translate stuff back and forth?</li>
        <li>
            Will I get to write pixel shaders?</li>
        <li>
            What kind of color support are you going to have?</li>
        <li>
            Should I write my custom control using control composition with shapes, or should
            I be overriding Render or should I start creating Visuals?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Are there any others you guys want answered?
    </p>
