    My guinea pig died yesterday.&#160; We got home from our trip and picked her up from
    the friend that was taking care of her.&#160; She was old (almost 7!) and it was probably
    just her time.&#160; Rachel and I like to think that she waited until we got back
    to give up.&#160; We spent all yesterday crying and dealing with it.&#160; I know
    that it seems silly to cry over a guinea pig, but she was a very sweet pet and we
    loved her.
