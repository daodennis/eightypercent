        We are public!&#160; Ask me what you will.

        I've been working on the graphics systems for Avalon for over two years now and it
        is great to&#160;finially talk to people about it.&#160; Let me know what you think
        and if you have any questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are here, stop by the hands on labs tomorrow or Wed. and say hi.&#160; They
        haven't been that busy yet so I'll have plenty of time to chat.
