        The second thing that happened today is that we released <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html">libjingle</a> on
        sourceforge.&#160;Full details are up on the <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-all-way.html">Talk
        blog</a>&#160;and at <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2005/12/jingle-bells.html">code.google.com</a>.
        Sean Egan (of Gaim fame) packaged up the code that Talk uses to do p2p as a library
        for others to use.&#160; Hopefully this will start a flood of interoperable voice
        (and other p2p applications).&#160; So that anyone can use it the code is released
        under a berkeley style license. Sean put together some great docs on how to use the
        new library <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing to keep in mind -- we haven't harmonized the specs and libjingle yet.&#160;
        The goal is to have libjingle implement the spec as it matures.&#160; Right now it
        just interoperates with Talk and is pretty far from the Jingle docs that the JSF released.&#160;
        As the spec moves forward the code will converge.&#160; Most of the differences right
        now are syntax.&#160; For example the underlying technique for punching through NATs
        is unchanged and is an adaptation of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-06.txt">ICE</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've wanted to release this core part of the Talk application for a long time now
        and I'm super excited to see it happen. The combination of these new standards and
        the libjingle library should be pretty potent.&#160; And since&#160;Jingle can be
        used for more than just voice, I'm sure we'll see this stuff used in interesting and
        surprising ways that we never envisioned.
