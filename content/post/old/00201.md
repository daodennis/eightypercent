        Check out the <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/forum.asp?forum=1019">DPReview
        forums</a> if you are interested in the devloping details.&#160; The rumors have been
        flying for a good two weeks or so, but it looks like it is official.&#160; Now the
        question is if there is going to be a new higher end camera (the EOS 3D) that has
        more features than the 20D but is smaller, lighter and cheaper than the 1D mk II.&#160;
        I'd love to buy <em>that</em> camera.&#160; I'm torn as to upgrade my D60 to the 20D.
