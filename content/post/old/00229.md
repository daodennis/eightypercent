        Here is a photo that I didn't take:

        Good news!&#160; We are having a baby.&#160; My wife is pregnant. I know that people
        usually say "we are pregnant" but she is the one that went through the nausea and
        has to deal with carrying the baby around for 9 months.

        The ultrasound from this morning looks good.&#160; It is still pretty early yet (she
        is 17 weeks along -- due date is June 21st) but the ultrasound tech said that it looked
        like our baby is a girl.

        Now I have to figure out how to be a father!
