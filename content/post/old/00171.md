        I'm back home and doing laundary and catching up on the Sopranos.&#160; Here is another
        pano:

        I'm going to try to get together a bunch of photos to get printed as <a href="http://www.westcoastimaging.com">West
        Coast Imaging</a>&#160;is having a <a href="http://www.westcoastimaging.com/wci/page/services/more/specials.htm">special</a> on
        smaller prints that ends April 7th.&#160; They have a cool printer that uses LEDs
        to light up regular old photo paper that is developed in traditional chemistry.&#160;
        The whole thing is color profile savvy so you can be sure that you'll at least get
        within spitting distance of good color.&#160; I've done prints with them before and
        been happy with the results.
