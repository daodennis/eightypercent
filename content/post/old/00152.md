        Actually, I'm proud of the work that we are doing on Avalon, but I hate the name.&#160;
        It just sounds lame and dorky to me.&#160; I guess this is what you get when you vote
        on a code name.&#160; Aero and Indigo are much better names.&#160; In fact, the shell
        team has the best code names:&#160;Aero, Jade, Luna, Plex.&#160; I guess it is because
        they have designers who are creative types.

        The worst code name I can think of right now was for NT4.&#160; It started out being
        just and update to the shell.&#160; So, it was called the "Shell Update Release" that
        got abbreviated SUR.&#160; They even made T-Shirts that said "We don't need any stinkin'
        code name."

    <p>
        Anyone haved examples of other really bad code names for projects?
