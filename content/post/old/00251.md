        [In case you aren't up on the MS lingo -- the&#160;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/"><strong>P</strong>rofessional <strong>D</strong>evelopers <strong>C</strong>onference</a> is
        the once in a while conference that Microsoft holds where they talk about all things
        Microsoft.&#160; It is more forward looking than a lot of the other MS conferences.]

        I'm going to the PDC to keep up with what is going on with Windows.&#160; Drop me
        a line if you'd like to chat about Google Talk or anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not sure which sessions I'm going to attend yet, but I can tell you that my interests
        have shifted somewhat since I've shipped software on the outside.&#160; I'm much more
        interested in stuff that can help make Google Talk better now than more forward looking
        stuff that may not ship for another year yet.&#160; I'm also a lot less interested
        in huge frameworks that tie my product to Windows.&#160; While Google Talk is right
        now just a Windows only application, we've worked hard to keep the Win32 only stuff
        isolated so that it will be easier for us to port/write on other platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, is anyone working on an Avalon/.Net Jabber/XMPP client?&#160; I've
        been looking at the SSL/TLS support in the WinFX SDK and it might be possible to do
        it without any reliance on external libraries.
