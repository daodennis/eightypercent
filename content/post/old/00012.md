<P>Gary Burd has a new <A href="http://gary.burd.info">blog</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked with Gary back in the day on the IE 4 team.&nbsp; After that he moved on to doing much more interesting things.</P>
<P>David Bau also has a <A href="http://www.dabbler.org/">blog</A>, but it looks like he doesn't update it much.&nbsp; David was also on the IE team back in the day but he is much more famous now for his little windows helper: <A href="http://notesbydave.com/toolbar/doc.htm">Dave's Quick Search Toolbar</A>.</P>
