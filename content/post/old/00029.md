<P>ChrisAn <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/2003/02/06.html#a167">says</a> that I need to support permalinks.  This is part of the plan but I need to renumber my entries (as I have duplicates now!) and I want to think long and hard about what I want my permalinks to be.  I'd also like to do this only once so that I don't spam everyone using Syndirella or other RSS aggregators as my feed completely changes.
<P>Ideally I'd like to create a page per day or per week and have the permalink point into that.  However, I don't want to break links around midnight as I move back to Seattle at some point.  I think that I'm going to start storing a time zone with each of my entries and use that to adjust when figuring out which entries go in which days.  
<P>In some ways this would be easier with a server side solution as I would just have an archive page that takes the entry number as a parameter.  There are other advantages to the client side solution though.
