    <p>
        I have this urge to go retro, switch back to film and dig out my darkroom stuff.&#160;
        I think the real motivation is to buy an outrageously expensive Leica customized with
        my engraved signature on it.&#160; Try it out for yourself <a href="http://www.leica-camera.com/alacarte/index/language/en/">here</a>.&#160;
        My camera came out to $4020.&#160; I assume shipping is extra.&#160; I know that a
        lens is.&#160; "Add to my cart."
