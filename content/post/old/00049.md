<P>Ordered one of <a href="http://www.bogenphoto.com/product/templates/templates.php3?sectionid=274&itemid=773">these</a> bad boys today.  I can't wait.  I'm also going to order one of <a href="http://acratech.net/prod01.htm">these</a> pretty soon too.
<P>My old tripod had a bent leg and was super heavy.  With this combo I'll be set to carry the tripod on longer hikes.  Things should start warming up soon and I can start exploring the environs around Boise.
