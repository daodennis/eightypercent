        Check out <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,59900,00.html">this</a> article
        in wired.&#160; With a <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/CodeBlue">wife</a> that
        is a doctror, it always amuses me the capacity for people to think that the "system"
        is hiding the real cure from them.&#160; It seems to me that people always value the
        remedies that they have to go outside the "system" for.&#160; It is like that episode
        of Sienfeld where his dad would only take a gift if it were stolen. Is there a name
        for this phenomenon?

        (I tried to find the&#160;specific episode for that Sienfeld reference but it turns
        out that there are better episode guides for <a href="http://www.whoosh.org/epguide/">Xena</a>&#160;and <a href="http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/GEFP/EpisodeIndex.htm">Good
        Eats</a> than I can for Sienfeld.&#160; The web works in mysterious ways.)
