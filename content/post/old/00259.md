    <p>
        For serious portraits or low light situations, we've been taking lots of pictures
        of Annie with my Canon 20D.&#160; I also have a Canon SD300 for convience and video.&#160;
        The video modes on these small cameras are amazing!&#160; I can't see myself needing
        more than a couple minutes of video.&#160; Who needs a video camera for their kids
        these days? 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, dealing with the video out of these things can be tricky.&#160; I post my
        pictures to <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">smugmug.com</a> (if you sign up use
        my referrer coupon: <span class="title">aoVCSFuPXSipF</span>).&#160; I've got a plan
        that also lets me upload videos.&#160; The only format they take is MPEG 1 (for compat
        reasons)&#160;but the camera produces MJpeg AVI files.&#160; Converting these things
        can be trickier than you'd think.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is what I've ended up doing -- if someone else has a better solution let me know. 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download 'MPlayer-mingw32-1.0pre7.zip' from <a href="http://www2.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/win32-beta/">here</a>&#160;[7.8M].
            There are a lot of distributions out there but most of the older ones don't work for
            some reason.&#160; This one at least does something reasonable. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Unzip this into a directory.&#160; I put it under an MPlayer dir in my "program files"
            dir. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a batch file with this in it (call it <code>convert-avi.cmd</code> or something):<pre>@echo off
setlocal

set CL="c:\Program Files\MPlayer\mencoder"
set CL=%CL% -oac lavc -ovc lavc -of mpeg -mpegopts format=mpeg1
set CL=%CL% -af lavcresample=44100 -vf hqdn3d,harddup -srate 44100
set CL=%CL% -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg1video:keyint=15:vrc_buf_size=1000
set CL=%CL%:vrc_maxrate=2500:vbitrate=2500:trell:mbd=2:vrc_init_cplx=1000 
set CL=%CL% -ni -nobps 
set CL=%CL% -o %~n1.mpg %1
%CL%</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Call your brand new batch file with the <code>.avi</code> file you need to convert.&#160; It will
            create a file in the current directory with the same name but a <code>.mpg</code> extension.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This command line is totally out of control.&#160; I couldn't find a way to wrap lines
        in batch files so I did the environment variable trick.&#160; I got this via trail
        and error and I'm not sure what all of the options mean, but here is what I know it
        does: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Encodes as MPEG 1 into a .mpg file 
        </li>
        <li>
            Upconverts the audio to 44.1 kHz as that is the only freq I could get to work. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't do any resizing or framerate changes (leaves it at 640x480x30fps for my files) 
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses a fairly high bitrate to make sure the quality stays good 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For a 18.5 second video doing this compression (just to MPEG1 -- let alone something
        better) cut&#160;a 35M AVI file down to 5.5M.&#160; The only problem I haven't figured
        out is that the first frame is really pixelated.&#160; If you can figure it out you
        win my undying gratitude.&#160; Check out the docs&#160;<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/index.html#toc">here</a> or <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Bonus:</strong> You can rotate the&#160;video during the conversion with a <code>,rotate=90</code> on
        the after <code>harddup</code> on the -vf argument. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, check out a cute video of Annie <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Stuff/MVI_0478.mpg">here</a>.
