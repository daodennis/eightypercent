<p>I think I'm going to evolve my blogging software some more over the next couple of weeks.  I want to add the following features:
<ul>
<li>True WYSIWYG HTML editing.  I'm still writing HTML directly.  I think that I'm going to steal whatever Chris has in BlogX.
<li>Stories.  I want to be able to easily do one-off pages.
<li>Content macro expansion.  I want to be able to name a page or an entry and have a friendly way to refer to it.  Radio does this (I think) by just looking at words in quotes.  I may do the same.
<li>Photo gallery.  Ideally I'd like to be able to dump a bunch of files in a directory and have it create thumbnails and generate gallery pages.  I'd also want a UI for dealing with this stuff:  Ordering files, adding descriptions, etc.  I've been using <a href="http://www.pbase.com">PBase</a> for a while now but I think I want a better client side UI.
</ul>
<p>Right now the UI for JoeBlogger is dead simple.  There is no "save" button.  Just a "New Entry" and an "Upload" button.  There is a calendar control for finding entries and a list for all of the entries for that day.  My goal is to keep it that simple as I add these new features.
<p>BTW, I still plan on finishing the stand alone FTP uploader first!
