<P>This is a test of an entry generated in my tool.  I have to type in raw HTML right now, but everything appears to be working...</P>
<P>Here is a screen shot of the current UI:</P>
<IMG src="/Stuff/JoeBlogger2.JPG" >
<P>Things yet to do...</P>
<UL>
<LI> Use MSHTML for rich editing.  And switch back and forth in a reasonable way. (Does anyone out there have a simple example I can drop in here?  I'm not looking forward to screwing with all of the interop)
<LI>Automatic upstreaming
<LI>Allow changing of time on an entry
<LI>Deleting and other such management of an entry
<LI>Categories!
<LI>Work on my template to improve the look of my site
<LI>Multiple site management and site configuration.  A lot of stuff is hard coded right now.
</UL>
<P>I've also decided that storing the entries in an xml file per day is a bad idea.  The timezones will get you.  I store the timestamp on an entry using GMT but the XML file (which is used as input into the UI) is based on local time.  I also use localtime all over the place in the UI.  I'll probably move to a flat list of entries (one per XML file) at some point and just figure out the local day assignments at runtime.  This will map much better to a real database anyway.</P>
