    <p>
        We aren't getting much sleep, but this has been the best experience of my life so
        far.&#160; I never thought I could love anyone so much.&#160; I've been trying hard
        to support Rachel and Anne as much as possible as we all figure out how to deal with
        each other.&#160; Here are some more pictures of Anne (and Rachel).
