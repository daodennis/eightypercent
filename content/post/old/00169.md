    <p>
        I'm off to New Zealand for a vacation with my brother-in-law (my sister's husband).&#160;
        We are going to get to Auckland, pick up our car rental and then wing it.&#160; I
        have some guide books to read on the (long) flight over there.&#160; I should be back
        sometime the week after next with some great pictures and experiences.

        When I get back I plan on writing more on what is going on with Avalon graphics.&#160;
        Just yesterday I did a short interview video thingy&#160;for <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com">Scoble</a>.&#160;
        I'm not sure when and how this will hit the web, but stay tuned.
