<P>I have a calendar that now points to my archives.  I think that I'm at feature parity with what I was using from Radio, at least with respect to blog generation.  I didn't use any tables in my layout, so let me know if things don't look good in a browser other than IE for windows.
<P>I think that I'm done for tonight.  Next I'm going to work on an FTP upstreamer so that I can just hit a button (or work it on a timer/file system change notification) to upload the site instead of using <a href="http://www.smartftp.com">SmartFTP</a> to upload manually.
<P>In some ways this would be a lot easier with a server side solution backed up to SQL server.  I'm tempted to switch over, but I really do like the idea of client side+FTP.
