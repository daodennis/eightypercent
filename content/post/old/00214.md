        Check it the article about Google hiring at the <a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/30438.htm">NY
        Post</a>.&#160; The mention me and this blog but of course don't link to me.&#160;
        This media stuff is pretty crazy.&#160; I don't think that someone like me moving
        around is really that newsworthy.&#160; I'm definitely not as high profile as <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/">Adam</a>.

        One correction:&#160; I wasn't <em>the</em> lead developer on Avalon, but rather one
        of many lead developers.&#160; The group is pretty big and my leaving, while I'm sure
        they will miss having me around, won't put the project in jeopardy or anything.
