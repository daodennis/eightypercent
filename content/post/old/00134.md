    <p>
        So I saw the news items about the new security issues in Office and went to update
        my home install via <a href="http://www.officeupdate.com/ProductUpdates/default.aspx">office
        update</a>.&#160; Unfortunately&#160;you need office SP2 to install the patches and
        you need your original install media to install SP2.&#160; I just moved.&#160; I have
        no idea where the original media is.&#160; How many people&#160;out there are in the
        same boat?&#160; What if someone (gasp) pirated their copy of Office?&#160;&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        Requiring original media to install security updates seems like a bad plan to me.&#160;
