    <p>
        Long time no blog.&#160; We've been super busy with the holidays and little Annie.

        In case you missed it you should check out the <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/">official
        Google Talk blog</a>.&#160; Thanks to Ana and Mike for putting this together.

    <p>
        Any team member (or Googler that has an interest in Talk) is welcome to post but I'm
        not sure what everyone might be interested.&#160; If you have an idea leave a comment
        here and I'll see what I can do.
