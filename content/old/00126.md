    <p>
        I love <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0117167/2003/08/01.html#a410">this</a>.&#160;
        When we are designing APIs, we think about this type of thing.&#160; We want to make
        it easier for the "bad programmer" to write code that isn't so bad.&#160; However,
        you can only do so much.
