<P>If you see this then I uploaded everything using my new FTP support.
<P>Right now I just upload everything every time.  However, it shouldn't be difficult for me to keep a dictionary of file times so I can keep track of what is new since the last upload.
<P>I also need to do the uploading on a different thread and report status.
