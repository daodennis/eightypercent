<P>I didn't get off my ass and create my own system yet so I'm still using Radio. As long as I keep things simple I only have to shut it down once per entry.&nbsp; I did do a little bit of work on my RSS Aggregator.&nbsp; It is starting to look like a real program.&nbsp; Sometime over the next week <A href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/">Dare</A> and I are going to get together and merge codebases.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.gerhardschneider.net/">Gerhard</A> and Angela came over tonight and we made dinner.&nbsp; We did a recipe out of the <A href="http://www.altonbrown.com">Alton Brown</A>&nbsp;<A href="http://www.altonbrown.com/pages/bookit.html">cookbook</A>.&nbsp; I really like this book and Alton's show, <EM>Good Eats</EM>.&nbsp; We did the "Chicken Piccata" on page 170 and it turned out pretty good.&nbsp; For desert we made a something from one of his shows: <A href="http://www.foodtv.com/foodtv/print/recipe/0,6255,18457,00.html">Spicy Pineapple Sauce</A>.&nbsp; That turned out well also.</P>
<P>The spicy pineapple sauce calls for&nbsp;a finely minced habanero pepper.&nbsp; I did the mincing and about an hour latter I rubbed my eye.&nbsp; The searing pain could only be stopped with prolonged dunking of my head under the sink.&nbsp; Where is one of those eye wash things from chemistry class when you need them?&nbsp; I've learned my lesson -- always wear gloves when dealing with hot peppers.</P>
