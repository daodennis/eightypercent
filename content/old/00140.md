    <p>
        The reason I haven't been posting is that I've been setting up a new computer here
        at home.&#160; I got rid of my 1.4GHz Athlon and replaced it with a sweet 2.8GHz P4.&#160;
        The 800MHz memory interface along with a new <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/index.php?LT=english&amp;Language_s=2&amp;url_place=product&amp;p_serial=TAC-T01&amp;other_title=+TAC-T01+Wave%20Master">case</a>&#160;and
        mirrored RAID 120GB SATA drives make this a sweet ride.&#160; The main reason that
        I upgraded is that I've been taking a ton of photos and I haven't been as diligent
        at backing them up as I should be.&#160; The mirrored drives are an extra level of
        insurance.

        Plus, blue LEDs just look sweet.&#160; Now all I need is a big tailpipe and "Powered
        by HKS" stickers!

        I haven't picked a new videocard yet.&#160; But when I do, I'm going to get the most
        powerful thing that I can afford.&#160; Come to the PDC and you'll see what I've been
        working on and why!
