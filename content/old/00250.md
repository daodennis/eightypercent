    <p>
        There are some other members of the team who have web sites that I'd like to point
        to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.glaak.com/">Gayle Laakmann</a> -- Gayle just joined our team a
            couple of weeks ago, but she has already made her mark. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.brightlycoloredfood.com/">Chad Thornton</a> -- Chad was the main
            designer for Google Talk.&#160; He is one of the reasons that the application has
            such a clean and fresh look. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.rezab.com">Reza Behforooz</a> -- Reza has been working on the
            Google Talk server from the start.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are probably some that I've missed, but I haven't seen their posts yet. 
    </p>
    <p>
        [<strong>Update: </strong>Fixed link to Chad!] 
        <br />
        [<strong>Update:</strong> Added Reza]
    </p>
