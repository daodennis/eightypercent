        Happy fourth!

        I just wanted to post a note bragging about my sister, Jill.&#160; The Chicago Tribune
        just <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0607040196jul04,1,4767917.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true">ran
        an article</a> about her and her daughter Ellie.&#160; Ellie has what they are calling
        "Sensory Integration Disorder."&#160; She is basically really hyper and needs to jump,
        spin, rock, swing, etc.&#160; I think I probably had a touch of something similar
        when I was small.&#160; One of the things that helps&#160;Ellie has been a weighted
        vest.&#160; Jill couldn't find any she and Ellie liked and so made one herself.&#160;
        It turned out so well, she decided to start making them for others.&#160; 
    </p>

        I've helped her get a web site up and running to show off what she has done.&#160;
        Check it out at <a href="http://www.customweightedvests.com">www.customweightedvests.com</a>.
        You can also check out some other custom sewing she does at <a href="http://www.stitchessosweet.com">www.stitchessosweet.com</a>.&#160;
