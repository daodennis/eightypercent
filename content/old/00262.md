        Last night was the first time Annie slept through the night.&#160; We put her to bed
        around 8pm and it is now 6:20am and she is still asleep. We've been working over the
        past couple of nights to eliminate her&#160;late night&#160;feeding and help her to
        get back to sleep on her own.

        I mentioned to my wife this morning I feel like we discovered the lost city of gold.&#160;
        Even if it doesn't go like this every night it is good to know that it can be done.
