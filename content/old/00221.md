    With the advent of our new office, a lot of people have been asking (via email or
    comments on the blog here) about jobs at the Kirkland office.&#160; For a variety
    of reasons, I really can't do much on the recruiting side.&#160; If I've worked with
    you and you don't work for Microsoft, feel free to drop me a line.&#160; Otherwise,
    your best bet is to send email to <a href="mailto:jobs@google.com">jobs@google.com</a> as
    specified <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/">here</a>.&#160; Even though Kirkland
    isn't listed there, I'm sure you can reference the office in any email you send. I
    wish I could be everybody's inside line, but I can't.
