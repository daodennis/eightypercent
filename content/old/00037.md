<P>Ha, I just read Michaels <a href="http://michaelw.net/Articles/Idontgettheweblogcalendar.html">article</a> on why he considers calendars on weblogs useless.  Funny I read this right after implementing mine.
<P>Well, the reason that I did mine is that I want my archives to be reachable in some fashion -- perhaps if only for google.  A search or keyword "related" section would be more usable, for sure.
