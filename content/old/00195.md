        If you haven't seen it yet, you should read the sad and scary story of Ian and his <a href="http://www.brownequalsterrorist.com/artiststatement/">run-in
        with homeland</a> security at the Ballard Locks here in Seattle.

        Well, I was driving past the locks yesterday and telling my wife this story.&#160;
        I floated the idea that it would be cool to organize a photoshoot in support of Ian.&#160;
        Well -- I'm behind the curve.&#160; Mykoleary has already <a href="http://www.blueneedle.com/wordpress/archives/2004/07/13/ballard-locks-photo-workshop-sunday-august-1st-2004-1pm-4pm/">organized</a> one
        of these on August 1st.&#160; I have to check but I think I may be out of town.&#160;
        I'll be there in spirit at least!
