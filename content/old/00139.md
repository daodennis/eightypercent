    <p>
        At the party I've come up with a law.&#160; You heard it here first: 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>"If I can write&#160;80% of a piece of software in a weekend, there is no
        business model for that software."</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>
        I fundamentally believe that there is no money to be made by selling people blogging
        tools (like Radio).&#160; They are just too easy to write.&#160; Providing a hosting/blogging/etc.
        service is another thing entirely.
