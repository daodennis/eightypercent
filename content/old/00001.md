<P>I've finally beaten radio into submission and have it uploading to my domain.</P>
<P>It uploads in batches of 25 files and for some reason was stalling and taking forever.&nbsp; After tweaking stuff to try to take care of the staling problem it looks like it might be working now...</P>
<P>In the end I ended up debugging through the very strange scripting language that they use.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp;wacky mix between a really primitive <A href="http://www.omniscium.com/nerdy/ip/">intentional programming</A> (with the outlining) and pascal.&nbsp; The environment for editing and debugging this stuff just seems arcane.&nbsp; This just screams for .Net....</P>
<P><EM>.Net killed the Radio star..</EM></P>
