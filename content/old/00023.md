And life is grand<BR>
And I will say this at the risk of falling from favor<BR>
With those of you who have appointed yourselves<BR>
To expect us to say something darker<BR>
And love is real<BR>
And though I realize this is not a deep observation<BR>
To those of you who find it necessary<BR>
To conceal love or obscure it, as is the fashion<BR>
