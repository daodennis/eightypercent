        They call new Google employees Nooglers.&#160; That was what I was last week when
        I was down in Mountain View.&#160; It was a pretty exciting week.&#160; I went to
        some training classes and got my computers set up and such.&#160; I spent quite a
        bit of time working and hanging out with other Googlers.&#160; Everyone was super
        smart and down to earth.&#160; I learned a lot and had a great time.

        At the end of the week I got my Noogler hat (propeller on top, of course) at a company
        wide friday event.&#160; I've been digging in this week back in Seattle.&#160; I'm
        hoping that I can get my first checkin in by thursday.&#160; My only job now is to
        write code and ship product.&#160; That is about all I can say too :)
