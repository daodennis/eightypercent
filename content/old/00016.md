    <p>
        I'm really liking <a href="http://www.syndirella.com/">Syndirella</a>.&#160; One of
        the sites that I read a lot is the <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/">Luminous
        Landscape</a>&#160;but it doesn't have an RSS feed.&#160; Instead, I've used the html
        scraping feature of Syndirella to parse out news items.&#160; The mechanism is pretty
        limiting, but I was able to make it work.&#160; Here is the data you need (save the
        file and import to Syndirella): <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Stuff/LumLandscape.xml">LumLandscape.xml</a>
