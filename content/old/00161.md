    <p>
        I went to a great holiday party last night thrown by my neighbors, Bob and Carol.&#160;
        We moved in quite a while ago&#160;but hadn't really had a chance to interact with
        any of our neighbors yet.&#160; This was a great opportunity for us to not only chat
        with our hosts, but also others from around the neighborhood.&#160; It turns out that
        the internet makes the world even smaller.&#160; Bob had run across my blog and already
        knew more about me (or at least my work!) than I knew about him.

        I also chatted with our neighbors on the other side, Gary and Marge.&#160; Gary is
        a long time photographer that just recently went digital with a Canon 10D and a sweet
        lens setup.&#160; He sent me a link to some of <a href="http://pbase.com/mgmoogk">his
        images</a>.&#160; These were done with film -- a Pentax 6x7 that he recently sold.&#160;
        I really need to get off of my butt and put together a gallery of some of my better
        up on the net.
