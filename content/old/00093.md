    <p>
        Brian (no blog?) suggested <a href=" http://www.alentus.com/hosting/aspnethosting.asp ">Alentus.com</a> (where
        do people come up with these names?).&#160; This looks like the best deal I've seen
        so far: $25/mo for 400MB.&#160; I'm off to Seattle for a couple of days now so I'll
        have to check this out when I get back.

        I've gotten another nibble but I haven't heard back yet, so I'm still looking.
