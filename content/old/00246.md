        Dear Lazyweb, 
    </p>
    <p>
        Where can I download a debug version of Firefox?&#160; It just started crashing on
        start for some reason.&#160; I'm sure debug spew would clear it right up.&#160; I
        now I can build my own copy, but I have other things on my mind right now. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks, 
    </p>
