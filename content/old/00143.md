    <p>
        I made the cut and I'm going to be going to the PDC.&#160; Here is the where and when
        of where I'm going to be for sure: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I will be proctoring some of the client "Hands On Labs."&#160; I'll be working Monday,
            Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm going to be an Expert at the "Ask the Experts" event on Tuesday night.&#160; I
            don't remember the exact name of the table/room we'll be in, but look for the closest
            thing to Avalon client graphics. 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'll be cheering Greg Schechter on as he presents an in depth intro to Avalon graphics
            at the CLI341 breakout on Tuesday afternoon (3:45-5:00). 
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm not scheduled to officially man the Avalon booth, but I'll probably be hanging
            out there some of the time. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Anything else you guys think I should hit?&#160; Some of the "Birds of a Feather"
        sessions look like fun.&#160; The one titled: "Strategic Decisions and Rich Client
        War Stories: Designing today for "Whidbey" and "Longhorn"" looks good along with the
        "VS.NET Secret Tips &amp; Tricks" session.&#160; "What is Windows in an HD World?"
        looks like fun too! 
    </p>
