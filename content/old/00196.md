    Yesterday Rachel and I <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/08/07.html#a8048">went
    over to the Scoble estate</a> for a BBQ.&#160; It was great to see Robert and Maryam.&#160;
    The food and company was excellent.&#160; The conversation drifted between geeky things
    (cameras, HDTV, Tivo/Media Center) and other non geeky things (jokes, BBQ technique,
    etc.)&#160; I also finially met Mr. Winer -- an interesting experience.
