    <p>
        I <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/09/02.html">left Microsoft for
        Google</a> one year ago today.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've got to be honest; it was a little scary when I left.&#160; I started at Microsoft
        right out of college after two internships.&#160; Up until a year ago, the lion's
        share of my professional experience had been at Microsoft.&#160; Microsoft can be
        a very comfortable place (much less so since they've been cutting benefits).&#160;
        From the outside, I've also been able to look at Microsoft with different eyes.&#160;
        What I used to rationalize away now appears <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001835.php">absurd
        on the face</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is one year&#160;later and I'm sure that I made the right decision.&#160; I've
        been much happier over the last year at Google.&#160; I'm sure some of it was the
        excitement of just doing something different, but a lot of it really came from the
        energy of those I work with and actually <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/08/23.html#a249">shipping
        product</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh yeah, and my non-compete and non-solicit contracts with Microsoft have now expired.&#160;
        If you are looking for new challenges feel free to send me a resume.
