    <p>
        I haven't updated my blog in forever and I'm probably going to abandon my homebrew
        static client generated site for something like <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> at
        some point but I haven't had time to make the transition. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, I'd like to save people some pain and document the steps I have go
        through to upgrade my Highpoint RocketRaid 2220 on Linux.&#160; I installed the driver
        a while ago and don't remember the exact steps for that, so this is just what I do
        to upgrade.&#160; I wrote a little shell script: 
    </p>
    <pre>#! /bin/sh -v

# Update this version every time you upgrade.
VER=2.6.15-29-686

# To update the highpoint driver:
# 1) Download latest highpoint driver from: 
#
# http://www.highpoint-tech.com/BIOS_Driver/rr222x/Linux/
#
# 2) Patch driver by changing wrong kernel #ifdefs in osm/linux/os_linux.c  
#   KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,15) -&gt; KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,16)

# Disable sata_mv.ko by moving it to a new directory.  This driver
# conflicts with highpoint driver.  I don't know if this is the
# "right" way to do this, but it works.
sudo mkdir -p /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled
sudo mv /lib/modules/${VER}/kernel/drivers/scsi/sata_mv.ko /lib/modules/${VER}.disabled/

# Make sure kernel headers are installed
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-${VER}

# Make new hpt driver:
cd ~jbeda/sources/rr222x-linux-src-1.07/product/rr2220/linux/
make KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build
sudo make install KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/${VER}/build

# make a new ramfs
# mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-27-686 /lib/modules/2.6.15-27-686
sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-${VER}</pre>
    <p>
        Good luck. I hope this helps people out there that are stuck with this thing. I'm
        still looking for a good cheap solution to host lots of SATA drives on Linux.&#160;
        Port multipliers are there and aren't as cheap as they should be.&#160; The driver
        situation is pretty dire and there aren't that many non RAID (fake or not) &gt;4 ports
        out there.&#160; I haven't tried any SAS cards though -- perhaps the situation there
        is better.&#160; I'm also running an LSI MegaRAID SATA 300-8XLP with the megaraid
        driver.&#160; It wasn't as cheap but at least it works with a true open driver.&#160; 
    </p>
