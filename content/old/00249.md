    <p>
        We've been working to bring together our new IM service.&#160; Most of the development
        was centered up here in the Kirkland office.&#160; Watch this space (and others) for
        more news over the next couple of days.

        In case you've missed the fireworks, here is the summary of what we've done:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Instant messaging server based on the XMPP/Jabber protocol.&#160; This is an IETF
            approved protocol.&#160; Check out <a href="http://www.xmpp.org">www.xmpp.org</a> for
            more info.</li>
        <li>
            Out of the box support for many third party clients.&#160; Choose iChat, Gaim, Trillian
            or a host of others.&#160; We support them from day one.</li>
        <li>
            Our own client available for download from <a href="http://talk.google.com">talk.google.com</a>.&#160;
            We've concentrated on a simple to use and clean interface.&#160; We've tried to strip
            IM down to its essence.</li>
        <li>
            Support for voice calls between clients that just work.&#160; We've worked hard to
            support all sorts of network topologies.&#160; We are also using first class industry
            leading audio codecs.</li>
        <li>
            A commitment to openness moving forward.&#160; Choose your platform (Window, Mac,
            Linux, etc), choose your client (ours or others) and choose your service provider
            (we are commited to federation).&#160; We want to make IM as open as the web or email.</li>
    </ul>
