<p>Radio screwed the pooch and deleted all of my data.  That kind of put a rush on my own software.</P>

<P>Well, here it is.  It isn't much right now but I can load up my data and generate an index page and RSS feed.  I have to generate the xml files for entries by hand right now, but that will be one of the next things that I implement.  After that, I'll generate an archive.  The last thing I have to do before it will be usable is do an FTP upstreaming solution (similar to Radio, but one that doesn't hang)</P>

<P>Like I said -- .Net killed the Radio star</P>
