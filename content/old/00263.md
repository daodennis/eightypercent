        I'm sorry that I missed <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/2006-01.html#2006-01-27T19:31">Peter
        Saint-Andre's presentation</a> at Etel this last week.&#160; I wanted to be down there
        but it is hard to get to conferences with the baby and all.&#160; You can check out
        his slides off of that link.

        Peter used a presentation style that I really like a lot.&#160; I'd love to see how
        he pulled it off.&#160; Perhaps some video will surface?&#160; If you want to see
        videos of talks done in a similar style check out <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5100194058815018708&amp;q=lessig">Larry
        Lessig's talk on Google Print</a>&#160;or <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">Dick
        Hardt's talk on Identity 2.0</a>.&#160; Very cool.&#160; I'm not sure I could pull
        it off though :)

        Speaking of conferences, I <em>am</em> planning on being around for a day or two of <a href="http://www.von.com/">Spring
        VON</a>.
