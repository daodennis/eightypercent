    <p>
        Canon <a href="http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/eosdigital/index.html">just announced</a> the
        new 300D.&#160; The camera itself is ugly, and it is an annoying all flash site, but
        it looks like this could bust things open.&#160; Current prices for DSLRs (the 10D)
        is around $1350.&#160; Dropping this below $1000 could really expand the market.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm just waiting to read some reviews and see how this is positioned relative to the
        10D.&#160; Reiner and Alice (Reiner is a personality in the NT world) just got a 10D
        and I was playing with it the other day.&#160; It just feels more solid than my D60.&#160;
        I hope that the 10D feels the same way, even though it is covered with chrome crap
        (like the Elan IIe film camera I started with).
