    <p>
        I'm going to be part of the "20% Time" at the <a href="http://www.cfp2005.org/">15th
        Annual Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy</a> tonight.&#160; It is going
        to be tonight at 9pm at the Seattle Westin in the Olympic room on the second floor.&#160;

    <p>
        It looks like a good group.&#160; Dare is going to <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=34cb5ffb-fc74-47d2-bd40-19ef97706d01">be
        there</a>.&#160; I look forward to talking with him and others about 20% time and
        my experiences at Google so far.&#160; If you want to get started, check out my <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/03/24.html#a235">original
