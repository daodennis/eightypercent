        <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2003/06/26.html">Earlier</a>, I was
        wondering if the new G5 Macs would have an OS that could take advantage of their 64
        bit nature, or if Apple was going to take a short cut and run the G5 in a compat mode.&#160;
        Apparently, that <em>is</em> going to be the case, at least according to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/31995.html">this
        Register article</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a lot of ways, this is just more hype from Apple.&#160; Many Intel processesors
        (I don't know the exact ones) actually have a 36 bit addressing bus.&#160; Those extra
        4 bits mean that the processor can actually address 16 times as much memory as a 32
        bit addressing bus.&#160; The difference is between 4GB and 64GB.&#160; However, most
        Windows machines don't take advantage of that extra capacity.&#160; The APIs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/memory/base/address_windowing_extensions.asp?frame=true">are
        there</a> though, if you want to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, is the 64 bit nature of the G5 hype?&#160; As far as I can tell, right now the
        answer is yes.
    </p>

        (Well, I'm sure that someone will port 64 bit Linux to it, and that will be cool.&#160;
        It might become the cheapest way to get a 64 bit linux machine, if AMD doesn't beat
        them to the punch)
