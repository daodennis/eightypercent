    <p>
        I'm packing up to move back to Seattle, so don't expect a lot of posting over the
        next week.

        Telecommuting was fun, but I'm really feeling out of the loop at work.&#160; I miss
        my friends and living in a big(ger) city.&#160; I'm looking forward to everything
        except the real commute across 520 every day.&#160; Oh well, I guess you have to take
        the good with the bad.
