    <p>
        It is getting on to time for me to look for a new car.&#160; I was pretty settled
        on a <a href="http://www.bmwusa.com/site_layout/models/0328/0328_mdlPage.cfm">Z4 3.0i
        w/ SMG</a>&#160;but the new <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/FutureModelHomePage/0,3210,24842,00.html">350Z
        Roadster</a> is looking pretty sweet.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking at picking it up sometime in September, but I want to plan ahead.&#160;
        I was going to avoid the 350Z Roadster because of the typical new car feeding frenzy
        but it looks like availability might not be that bad.&#160; However, if I get the
        Z4, I can pick it up in Spartanburg, NC.
