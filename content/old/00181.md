    <p>
        I should have posted this earlier, but better late than never.&#160; I'm going to
        be speaking at WinHEC.&#160; It'll be session TW04006: Avalon Graphics - 2D, 3D, Imaging
        and Composition.&#160; If you are there and are interested in Avalon come check it
        out.&#160; I'll be going in to some detail on what happens between when a developer
        calls an API and we call Direct3D.&#160;&#160;If you aren't going to be there, wish
        me luck.&#160; The room holds 700 people (I think) and I've never talked in front
        of that many people before. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll also be hanging out in the tech lounge and be at our "Ask the Experts" session.
