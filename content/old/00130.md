    Thanks to <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/6fe7afc7-99fe-4181-96d2-c46dd0f99689">Chris</a> and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/08/18.html#a4289">Scoble</a> for
    linking to me for our job opening.&#160; I should be clear, the job is not working
    for me (I gave up all of my reports when I moved out to Boise for a while) but <em>is</em> for
    working on the Longhorn graphics team.&#160; The job is to help develop APIs and functionality
    at one level above DX.&#160; If you have any questions, please post a comment (if
    haloscan is up) or drop me a line at "Eightyprecent at Bedafamily.com".
