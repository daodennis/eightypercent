        <a href="http://objective.mine.nu/archive/2003/5/11.aspx#when:23:03:57.7891968">Chris</a> was
        nice enough to link to me and some of the latest highlights.&#160; Thanks Chris!

        Here are some answers to some of his questions:

            JoeBlogger does, by default now, produce XHTML compatible output.&#160; I don't have
            it saving out &lt;xhtml:body&gt; to the&#160;RSS feed yet.&#160; I'll get around to
            that eventually.&#160; Please download it and play with it and let me know what you
            think!</li>

            I got no problem with people linking to stuff that I mirror.&#160; Just link to me
            and send me the flow!</li>

            I am working in the same group that is doing the Longhorn desktop compositor.&#160;
            If you look at these videos <a href="http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2003/0509/kaigai01.htm">here</a>&#160;from
            WinHEC (a Japanese site, no less!), you can see KerryHam's hands.&#160; Kerry is one
            of the PMs in our group and, now that she is an internet celebrety, we are going to
            start up the Kerry fan club -- alt.fan.kerry.&#160; Let me know if you want to join.&#160;
            I'm working to help design (along with a bunch of others -- <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn</a> included)a
            set of APIs that we haven't made public yet.&#160; Stay tuned for the PDC to see what
            I'm doing.</li>
        <li>
            I don't hate all New York.&#160; It is too big a place for that.&#160; I definitely
            don't like the Yankees, though.&#160; A while ago I read an article in the NY Times
            Sunday Magazine that basically said, "Why is Washington, DC, the capitol of the US
            when everyone knows that NY is the true center."&#160; I guess that a few experiences
            like that has tained me.</li>
        <li>
            I'm really excited about the server and what we can do with it.&#160; For instance,
            I'd love to have a real CVS server.&#160; (GDN workspaces only lets you check out
            one file at a time and SourceForge isn't very MS friendly...) I know someone else
            who (I think) is doing something similar to my co-op idea, but I don't want to "out"
            him.&#160; If anyone has experience doing this stuff, I'm all ears.&#160; This could&#160;
            become a pretty popular model for stepping up from a regular web hosting type account.</li>
    </ul>
