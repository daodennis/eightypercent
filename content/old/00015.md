<P><A href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/22#400AMonth">Dave Winer</A>&nbsp;shares that he was surprised that one of his drugs is $400 per month.&nbsp; Just last week I went through the same thing.&nbsp; A drug that I've been taking retails for ~$400 a month.&nbsp; That is over $13 a pill.&nbsp; Every night I take a night out to the movies (well, in 1995) and my insurance pays for it.&nbsp; Online you can find it from US pharmacies for as little as $325.&nbsp; Canadian pharamacies are selling it into the US for $150.&nbsp; </P>
<P>With a wife who is a doctor and a pretty good understanding of economics, I understand why this discrepancy exists.&nbsp; I've also been to <A href="http://www.ruthschris.com/">Ruth's Chris</A> and <A href="http://www.elgaucho.com/elgaucho/index_S.html">El Gaucho</A> on the drug companies dime.&nbsp; The drug companies are setting themselves up for a peasant uprising.</P>
<P>I didn't notice because the health insurance plan has no copay.&nbsp; The pharmacist kept telling me how lucky we are to have such great insurance.</P>
