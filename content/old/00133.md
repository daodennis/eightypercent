    Well, it turns out that in my new house I can only get 256kbs up and 256kbs down.&#160;
    In the old place I was getting 640kbs up and 256kbs down.&#160; I guess I'm just too
    far from the CO.&#160; My choices are to (a) suck it up, (b) go with a cable modem
    and their onerous terms of service or (c) shell out big bucks for a business class
    line.&#160; So far (a) is looking good but I'm not happy about it.
