    <p>
        <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/greg_schechter/">Greg Schechter</a> (whose office
        is right next to mine) has a new blog and has posted some <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/greg_schechter/posts/41362.aspx">great
        info</a> on the Avalon Changeable pattern.&#160; This pattern was originally developed
        for the graphics space but is useful in many other places.&#160; I was going to write
        about changeables at some point but Greg beat me to it.
