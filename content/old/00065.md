<P>I want to gauge interest in a new project.  How many of you out there (and I know there are something like 7 of you :) would actually use a utility that did the following:
<ul><li>Had a list of local directories and FTP servers/paths
<li>Monitored those dirs (timer or file change notifications) for changes.
<li>Upstream new files (based on file times) to the FTP server.  This wouldn't be a full sync but would rather be a copy.  It would never delete anything from the server.
<li>Has a tray icon to let you know what is going on.
</ul>

<P>BTW, this is a feature stolen almost verbatim from Radio.  I think that it would be useful to break it out into its own utility.

<P>The real reason I would want this is that frickin' VS.Net doesn't have a way to deply an ASP.Net application to an FTP server.  You can copy it or use FP extentions, but you can't FTP that guy up there.

<P>I would include source and an installer for this guy.
<P>If you are interested, email me at <a href="mailto:eightypercent at bedafamily.com">eightypercent at bedafamily.com</a> and I'll think about putting something together.
