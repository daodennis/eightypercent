<P>I'm back in Boise and Chris is still kicking my ass with BlogX.
<P>I got mail from <a href="http://gary.burd.info/">Gary Burd</a> that my RSS feed was valid.  The problem was that I was using relative URLs in some of my entries.  I've fixed up the problem and I'll be sure to keep an eye on that in the future.
