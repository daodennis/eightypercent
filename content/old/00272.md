    <p>
        Coming in this morning, I heard a&#160;<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5567184">segment
        on NPR</a> covering a unique program that King Country is running to provide <a href="http://www.desc.org/1811.html">rooms
        for homeless alcoholics</a> in Seattle.&#160; The unique and controversial part of
        this program is that the residents can continue to drink.

        My wife, Rachel, has first hand experience with this problem from her work at the
        Harborview ER.&#160;&#160;Some of these "frequent fliers" are indeed part of the community
        at the ER. In fact, one of the patients that Rachel had lots of interactions with
        (ever since she was a med student!) recently died and it really shook her up.&#160;
        Anecdotally, Rachel has seen this program provide a positive impact.

        In any case, this novel program seems to me to be a unique way to approach a very
        difficult problem.&#160; It reduces the cost to the taxpayers and provides a safe
        place for these individuals.&#160; Obviously we would all like to see these problems
        solved, but, failing that, at least the county is trying to manage it.
