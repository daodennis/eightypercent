        I came back from my photo trip and started catching up on email and blogs.&#160; It
        looks like the Google Kirkland open house went well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The bigger news, in my mind, is the technical preview that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/avalon/avnov04ctp/default.aspx">Avalon
        guys shipped</a>.&#160; I'm going to have to download it and play around to see what
        all changed since I left. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was really hoping that they would get something out before the Longhorn beta.&#160;
        I'm sure this was a ton of hard work, but I think that it proves that decoupling Avalon
        and Longhorn was really the right decision.&#160; It will allow the Avalon guys to
        go full steam ahead.

        BTW, <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com">ChrisAn's blog</a> is a good place to start
        on some of this stuff.&#160; He has an app that you can download and play with.

        Congrats!
