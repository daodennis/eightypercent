    <p>
        Monday I start work again after taking three weeks off to spend with the <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/06/25.html">Anne</a>.&#160;
        If I've been slow to answer mail, that is why.&#160; It is amazing how much activity
        she needs.&#160; I had grand plans to get lots of cool stuff done while she was sleeping
        but somehow none of it got done.
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, tomorrow it is back to the salt mines.
    </p>
