    <p>
        Raymond, ever the source of interesting info, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/24/140283.aspx">details</a> how
        to extend the context menu in IE.&#160; This was the first feature that I coded up
        at MS after I joined back in 97.&#160; This came in late in the IE4 product cycle.&#160;
        It is cool to see that it still comes up once in a while.&#160; The original idea
        was to allow a dictionary program to let you right click on a word to get a definition.&#160;
        It turns out to be much more powerful than that.
