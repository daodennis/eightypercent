        <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> and I hung out tonight and went
        to dinner together.&#160; We started out from my house in Montlake and walked through
        the university to Aladdin Gyro's up north of 45th on the Ave.&#160; We were going
        to go to Thai Tom but the line was too long. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We talked about Google, Microsoft and the industry as a whole.&#160; Tip jars, Bush
        and how I should never expect to get social security (I already knew this).&#160;
        He's a good guy who likes to shake things up.

        Since everyone wanted to see me wearing my Noogler hat, I had him snap a quick picture
        with my new Canon 20D.&#160; I also grabbed a picture of him. We are both looking
        a little worse for wear from the long walk up there and back.

        If you really want to chew up some of my bandwidth (I may have to take this down)
        you can grab the original files (~2MB each) of <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/NooglerHat-orig.jpg">me</a> and <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/DaveWiner-orig.jpg">Dave</a>.&#160;
        These are jpgs right out the camera.&#160; Be warned that they are shot in the AdobeRGB
        color space so you should really view them in a color space aware application (something
        more like Photoshop and not IE).

        [Update:&#160; <a href="http://www.freeke.org/ffg">Dave Walker</a> suggested I check
        out <a href="http://www.scs.cs.nyu.edu/coral/">Coral</a> -- a distributed network
        cache by NYU as a way to reduce the bandwidth hit.&#160; The links above have been
        changed to give that a try.&#160; Post a comment if you have problems.]
