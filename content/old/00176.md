        In case you haven't seen it, part of my interview that I did with <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com">Scoble</a>&#160;is
        up at <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com">Channel9</a>.&#160; [BTW, big congrats to
        the Channel9 guys.&#160; The site looks great and it survived being slashdotted on
        its first day.&#160; How many dynamic sites do you know can handle a load like that
        so soon after launch?]

        I did a long interview with Scoble and he asked me a lot of questions. It is interesting
        that he the topic of "Is Avalon a way to take over the Web" is the first that they
        put up there.&#160; I'm glad that it is though as this is definately a hot button
        topic.&#160; I'll be sure to keep an eye on the comments on the video and answer any
        questions that you guys have.

        A little background on me: I joined the IE group at Microsoft in the middle of 1997
        right out of college.&#160; I'd interned twice -- once on a forgotten product called
        TeamManager and the second time on the OpenGL inside of Windows.&#160; When working
        on IE, I was responsible for, mostly, the data model for how we stored HTML in memory
        for processing and rendering.&#160; I touched a lot of other code, but my original
        nickname was "Tree Boy" (to <a href="http://www.ericvasilik.com/">Eric Vasilik's</a> "Tree
        Man" :)&#160; If you have questions on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=IMarkupServices">IMarkupServices</a>,
        I can probably answer them for you.

        A couple of years ago, I moved over to the then (very newly) formed Avalon Media Integration
        Layer and helped define the early vision of what we were going to do with 2D UI level
        graphics in Longhorn. (The DX team is all over 3D and games!)&#160; At one point all
        we knew that we wanted was CFS, which stood for "Cool Flying Stuff".&#160; We upgraded
        thaet to "Clickable Flying Stuff" and the graphics strategy for Avalon was born.&#160;
        Since then I've been hard at work helping to define and implement a lot of the graphics
        functionality in Longhorn.&#160; Seriously, I think that we are making a huge leap
        ahead for Windows and look forward to helping everyone understand what we are about.&#160;
        I'm also interested in hearing comments, suggestions and bug reports.
