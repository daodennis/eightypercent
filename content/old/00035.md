<p>Okay, <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/2003/02/16.html#a204">Chris</a> has put me to shame.

<p>To try and redeem myself I have my archives working now.  I also have permalinks.

<p>I haven't uploaded posts in a couple of days as I renumbered all of my entries and I didn't want to screw everyone's Syndirella feed until I had permalinks and guids working.

<p>To see some of the workings behind the scenes, <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Templates/Main.xslt">here</a> is the xslt for my main page.
