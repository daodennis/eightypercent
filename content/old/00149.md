    It is kind of sad that peoples <a href="http://www.sbsun.com/Stories/0,1413,208%257E24658%257E1725112,00.html">homes</a> are <a href="http://lang.sbsun.com/socal/gallery/?folder=news/102503_Waterman_fire">burning</a>&#160;around
    LA and and I'm just thinking of my flight being canceled.&#160; The house that my
    wife grew up in (and her dad built -- he is a contractor) probably burned in these
    fires.&#160; It was on David Way in the foothills in San Bernardino and backed up
    to the Waterman Canyon.&#160; Her family no longer owns it but it is sad to think
    that it is gone.
