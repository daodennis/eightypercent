        Annie and I watched a DVD this morning while I was feeding her.&#160; Actually, she
        wasn't paying that much attention, but I was.
    </p>
    <p>
        The DVD was <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/">Steve Kossack</a>'s new DVD documenting
        one of his workshops to Yosemite during the winter.&#160; The DVD is what Steve hopes
        will be first of a series: "<span class="style1">Steve Kossack: Photographing the
        Great American Landscape."&#160; This one is titled <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/DVD/index.htm">"Yosemite
        in the&#160;Winter."</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that I have the baby, I don't have the time to go on workshops like this, so this
        is the&#160;next best thing.&#160; If you are interested in landscape photography
        at all, this DVD will be of interest to you.&#160; If you haven't been on a photo
        workshop, the video will give you an idea of what one of those workshops is like --
        without the waking up at 4:30 am to hit a sunrise shoot.&#160; If you are planning
        on doing Yosemite on your own, Steve's DVD will provide an invaluable guide to how
        to approach the area and some great places to shoot.

        As for Steve himself, I've been on two of his workshops so far (Death Valley and <a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/past_ws/past04.htm#landmarks2">Landmarks
        of the Southwest</a>) and both were great.&#160; Steve really knows his stuff -- both
        on the photography side and on the natural and human history of the area.&#160; I've
        never been to Yosemite, but I'd love to go with Steve sometime in the future.
