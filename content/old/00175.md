        I had a rant here wrt RSS history, but considering the fact that it really doesn't
        matter and it is always best to stay positive, I'll withold comment :).

        Dave Winer has a bug up his but to <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/04/06#When:6:58:43PM">try
        and claim</a> that he invented the idea of syndication through XML (embodied via the
        RSS format).&#160; I don't think that anyone will argue that Dave has been syndication's
        biggest evangelist and has driven his fork of the formats forward relentlessly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I just wish he wasn't such an ass.&#160; RSS (and syndication) like so many things
        in the computer world evolved out of a soup of ideas that stretches way back.&#160;
        Every time Dave <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rssVersionHistory">(re)writes
        a history of RSS</a>, he always lists himself as the original invetor and visionary.&#160;
        The particular history linked to above fails to mention a format that was introduced
        with IE 4 called CDF.&#160; This was <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/1997/2/">submitted
        to the W3C</a> at least 9 months before the earliest date on Dave's "history."&#160;
        Now, I'd also venture a guess that there are tons of other prior art in the soup that
        CDF came out of.&#160; For someone who rails against the patent system for the way
        it cements credit for ideas that come out of a soup (think Amazon 1-click) he does
        a good job of trying to "patent" RSS. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The really sad part here is that Dave does himself such a disservice.&#160; He has
        a huge bully pulpit that he could use to push his (often) very good ideas.&#160; Instead,
        he spends time trying to rewrite this particular history.&#160; He undercuts his own
        credibility in the process.&#160; Instead of being an elder statesman of the computer
        industry who can cut through the red tape, he sets himself up as a mini Napoleon and
        creates more divisiveness.

        I think this quote from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/">The Big Labowski</a>&#160;sums
        up my thoughts on the subject: 
    </p>
    <blockquote><b>Walter</b>: Am I wrong?<br />
    <b>Dude</b>: No you're not wrong.<br />
    <b>Walter</b>: Am I wrong?<br />
    <b>Dude</b>: You're not wrong Walter. You're just an asshole.<br />
    <b>Walter</b>: All right then. </blockquote>
