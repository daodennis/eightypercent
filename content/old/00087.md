    <p>
        I'd like to switch to a new ISP. Here is what I'm looking for: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Reasonable rates. I'm thinking ~$20/month tops. 
        </li>
        <li>
            ASP.Net hosting 
        </li>
        <li>
            500Mb to 1Gb of space. I'd like to be able to put a lot of pictures up there. 
        </li>
        <li>
            No frills support 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reasonable access to log files. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It seems like there are a ton of LAMP shops out there offering a deal like this but
        I can't find anything that will host ASP.Net. Anyone know anything I don't? Do i have
        to get a bunch of friends together and colocate a box? Most places look like they
        really rip you on extra storage space. If I can't find anything good then I may drop
        the ASP.Net requirement and do most everything client side and FTP static pages up
        like I'm doing now. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Email me at 'Eightypercent at Bedafamily.com' if you have any ideas for me. 
    </p>
