        I haven't been posting anything lately because I've been so busy with work and Annie.&#160;
        It is funny how life gets in the way.

    <p>
        In any case, she really loves flowers.&#160; We try and go on a walk in the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/wpa/general.htm">Washington
        Park Arboretum</a>&#160;every day.&#160; She loves to hold and pick little flowers.&#160;
        Here is a quick photo I snapped of her today:

        Speaking of the Arboretum, almost every time I go there, I see the official bird of
        Seattle, the <a href="http://www.seattleaudubon.org/birding.cfm?id=44">Great Blue
        Heron</a>.&#160; Here is a snap of one of those guys from a couple of weeks ago.&#160;
        He has just caught himself some dinner.
