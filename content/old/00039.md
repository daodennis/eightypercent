<P>So, <a href="http://michaelw.net">MichaelW</a> invited me to the Montreal F1 races this summer.  I would love to be able to go but it is just too much money. I haven't been at Microsoft as long as Michael has...
<P>Instead, I'm in the process of trying to sign up to go on <a href="http://luminous-landscape.com/workshops/sk-dv-work.shtml">this photo workshop</a>, led by Steve Kossack.  This will be the first of this type of trip that I will have gone on.  It still isn't cheap but looks to be in line with similar excursions.  It also isn't <a href="http://luminous-landscape.com/workshops/africa-ws.shtml">this trip</a>.
