        Congrats to the <a href="http://www.picasa.com/">Picasa</a> guys on shipping v2!&#160;
        I know that they've been working super hard to get this out the door.

        If you do anything with photos and haven't had a chance to play with Picasa, you really
        owe it to yourself to check it out.
