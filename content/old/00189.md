    <p>
        Since writing the <a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/25.html#a188">article</a> in
        the Luminous Landscape, I've run across Max Lyon's <a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/cgi-bin/forum/cutecast.pl">forums</a> covering
        all things pano.&#160; Cool stuff I've discovered or been alerted to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A really sweet cheap<a href="http://www.tawbaware.com/cgi-bin/forum/cutecast.pl?forum=4&amp;thread=278"> DIY
            pano tripod</a> head using 8020 aluminum extrusion stock.&#160; I built one of these
            last week and it works great! 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.le-geo.com/kolor/autopano/">Autopano</a> -- a&#160;helper to automatically
            find the control points for panotools.&#160; PTAssembler can be set up to call this
            directly. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mihal/enblend/">Enblend</a> -- a tool to
            automatically do the blending between images based on the spatial frequency of the
            image at the seam. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a> -- a free (as in speech) appliaction
            for driving PanoTools.&#160; There is also an experimental replacement for PanoTools
            called nona.&#160; I haven't played with this yet but it is interesting to see this
            stuff develop.&#160; If this weren't GPL'd and similar to my real job, I'd love to
            get involved and write some code. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.ngallery.org/">nGallery</a> -- I installed this on an ASP.Net
            server and I'll be posting some new pictures soon.&#160; It was super easy to get
            up and running and looks configurable.&#160; This is something that I <em>could</em> get
            involved in and write some code. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Hopefully I'll have some example panos put together using the new setup soon.
