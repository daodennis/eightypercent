    <p>
        If you haven't noticed, I've haven't been posting in a while!&#160; I don't know about
        you, but I've been in a little bit of a funk after the PDC.&#160; It was really exciting
        but now it is back to life as usual.

        In any case, as a Christmas present for me and Rachel, I'm turning our basement room
        (23'x13'x9') in to a home theater.&#160; We aren't doing anything super elaborate,
        but I figured I'd put out what I'm doing to see if anyone has comments: 
    </p>

        Projector: Infocus X1<br />
        Screen: Home Depot Special DIY<br />
        Reciever: Yamaha RXV1400<br />
        Speakers: Axiom M22ti, QS4 and VP150.&#160; SS16 stands.<br />
        Subwoofer: SVS 20-39PCi (thinking about the PC+)<br />

        with screw on banana clips 
    </p>
    <p>
        We are planning on getting some new furniture down there along with painting the walls
        and such.&#160; 
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyone have any suggestions?&#160; 
    </p>
