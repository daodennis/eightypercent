        Argh!&#160; My flight has been canceled.&#160; LAX is apparently a mess.&#160; SriramS
        and I are hanging out in the bar near C8 in SEA so come by and say hi.&#160; We are
        sitting in the back corner, both wearing blue shirts (differnt shades). We are supposedly
        booked on a flight out of here at 6 to Portland.&#160; And then from there to LAX
        arriving after midnight. I've heard that Hillel Cooperman (who is giving our demo
        as part of the keynote) is in flight trouble also.

        will also after his flight is delayed.]&#160;
