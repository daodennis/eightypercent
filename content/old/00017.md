There is a MSFT blogger dinner tonight.&nbsp; It should be fun.&nbsp; It seems like more and more people are blogging.&nbsp; There is also a <A href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1114.html">shindig</A> happening at Crossroads on Tues.&nbsp; I'll probably try to make it to that one also since it looks to be a much bigger audience.&nbsp; It looks like it is going to be happening at 6pm.
