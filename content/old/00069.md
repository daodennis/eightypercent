<p>I haven't been posting lately because I've been super busy.  I've spent the weekend debugging a tough memory leak in some COM code.  I sure don't miss doing that with managed code!  
<p>I'm going to be in Redmond again tomorrow and Wednesday so updates won't be happening then either.  Oh well.
<p>BTW, I've made some progress on my FTP uploader but not as much as I'd like.  I'll post something here when I have something to show.
