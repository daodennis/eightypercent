    <p>
        I finally signed up at Haloscan and now have comments up here.&#160; I don't know
        if any of my 2 readers will care, but let's see what happens.

    <p>
        After the first outage at Haloscan, I'll probably give up and write my own comment
        system.&#160; I want to keep it seperate from JoeBlogger though so that JoeBlogger
        is still a client render/FTP too.&#160; The comment system will probably be similar
        to Haloscan in the way it is hosted on a page.
