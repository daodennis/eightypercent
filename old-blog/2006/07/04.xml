      <Title>Custom Weighted Vests</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Happy fourth!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I just wanted to post a note bragging about my sister, Jill.&amp;#160; The Chicago Tribune
        just &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0607040196jul04,1,4767917.story?ctrack=1&amp;amp;cset=true"&gt;ran
        an article&lt;/a&gt; about her and her daughter Ellie.&amp;#160; Ellie has what they are calling
        "Sensory Integration Disorder."&amp;#160; She is basically really hyper and needs to jump,
        spin, rock, swing, etc.&amp;#160; I think I probably had a touch of something similar
        when I was small.&amp;#160; One of the things that helps&amp;#160;Ellie has been a weighted
        vest.&amp;#160; Jill couldn't find any she and Ellie liked and so made one herself.&amp;#160;
        It turned out so well, she decided to start making them for others.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I've helped her get a web site up and running to show off what she has done.&amp;#160;
        Check it out at &lt;a href="http://www.customweightedvests.com"&gt;www.customweightedvests.com&lt;/a&gt;.
        You can also check out some other custom sewing she does at &lt;a href="http://www.stitchessosweet.com"&gt;www.stitchessosweet.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
