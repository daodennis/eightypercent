      <Title>New Google Talk Client</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you haven't heard yet, we shipped a new version of the Google Talk client to a
        small set of testers yesterday.&amp;#160; You can get a review over at &lt;a href="http://www.customizetalk.com/"&gt;customizetalk.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        Hopefully we'll fix any outstanding issues and get this version out to everyone soon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I wasn't super involved in this version but did manage to sneak a couple of features
        in.&amp;#160; The first was Friend Online notifications (defaults to off to avoid annoying
        people). I also did the new hover cards for your Friends.&amp;#160; I wanted people to
        be able to see all of the cool pictures in&amp;#160;true 96x96 pixel alpha blended glory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        We hope you like it!&amp;#160; Let us know what features are important to you by filling
        out our &lt;a href="https://services.google.com/inquiry/talk_suggest"&gt;suggestion form&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      <Title>New Jingle Spec</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I was going to stay away from all of the April 1st shenanigans, but couldn't pass
        up linking to the new Jingle transport spec that Peter Saint-Andre put together: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://www.jabber.org/jeps/jep-0183.html"&gt;JEP-0183: Jingle Telepathy Transport&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Nice one! 
    &lt;/p&gt;
