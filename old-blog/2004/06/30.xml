      <Title>Avalon Graph Demo Posted</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        It's (a)live!&amp;#160; Look &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9C1724D1-B63E-4D7D-835A-FF94A1FAD311&amp;amp;displaylang=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (up
        on ms.com) for the 3D Graph demo that shows off the 3D demo from WinHEC that I &lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2004/05/06.html#a182"&gt;talked
        about quite a while ago&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Here it is again:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://www.eightypercent.net/Images/3dgraph.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I apologize that this took so long to get out here.&amp;#160; I've been busy and it has
        been interesting to get this hosted on MS.com.&amp;#160; I have some other similar samples
        coming and I think that I'll just host them here directly.&amp;#160; I mostly took the
        demo code that Nathan and Robert had and cleaned it up for public consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Take a look at it and let me know what you think.&amp;#160; As Avalon moves forward, I'd
        like to keep this example up to date and add to it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you are interested in Avalon 3D and you haven't found his site yet, &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/"&gt;DanLehen&lt;/a&gt; has
        some great samples up and running.
    &lt;/p&gt;
