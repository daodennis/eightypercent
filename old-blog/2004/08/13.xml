      <Title>Traffic court</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        This morning I spend a couple of hours hanging out in the Redmond courthouse to contest
        a speeding ticket.&amp;#160; I didn't get my act together enough to file for discovery
        so I couldn't put together a real defense.&amp;#160; There appear to be two easy ways
        to beat a ticket around here.&amp;#160; First the infraction might not have been filed
        on time.&amp;#160; Second, your trail might not be speedy enough -- two months after the
        infraction, I think.&amp;#160; Neither of these applied to me so I ended up getting a
        deferred finding (a sort of probation). 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        While I probably could have done this via mail, it was enlightening to watch how things
        work.&amp;#160; First, your trial doesn't get scheduled really.&amp;#160; You are grouped
        with all of the other cases to be covered that morning.&amp;#160; You sit there from the
        beginning of the session until your name comes up.&amp;#160; The judge presiding this
        morning worked it such that the actual lawyers got to go first and the rest of us
        schmoes representing ourselves go after that.&amp;#160; It was interesting to see how
        much time it really took the lawyers to beat a case.&amp;#160; It mostly was about finding
        a loophole and arguing it.&amp;#160; The judge has some discretion as to how to interpret
        things but most of it is cut and dried.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The thing that really surprised me was that by the time my case came up there were
        no lawyers in the room.&amp;#160; This included the prosecutor.&amp;#160; I think it really
        sucks that you can be tried for an infraction without a prosecuting attorney even
        present.&amp;#160; To me it is a slap in the face that the state wants to extort money
        out of me (via the traffic ticket) without even bothering to have somebody there to
        personally do the extorting.&amp;#160; At least the mafia comes and collects in person.&amp;#160;
        Apparently this has been fought over and gone to the Supreme Bourt (at least that
        is what the judge said)&amp;#160;but I don't have the time to really dig in to it. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, I would urge everyone to contest a ticket just once to see how it all
        works.&amp;#160; Or just show up in Redmond courthouse courtroom two any morning and sit
        and watch. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
