      <Title>Congrats to the Avalon team</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I came back from my photo trip and started catching up on email and blogs.&amp;#160; It
        looks like the Google Kirkland open house went well. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The bigger news, in my mind, is the technical preview that the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/avalon/avnov04ctp/default.aspx"&gt;Avalon
        guys shipped&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; I'm going to have to download it and play around to see what
        all changed since I left. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I was really hoping that they would get something out before the Longhorn beta.&amp;#160;
        I'm sure this was a ton of hard work, but I think that it proves that decoupling Avalon
        and Longhorn was really the right decision.&amp;#160; It will allow the Avalon guys to
        go full steam ahead. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        BTW, &lt;a href="http://www.simplegeek.com"&gt;ChrisAn's blog&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start
        on some of this stuff.&amp;#160; He has an app that you can download and play with. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Congrats! 
    &lt;/p&gt;
