      <Title>Gyros with Dave</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com"&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; and I hung out tonight and went
        to dinner together.&amp;#160; We started out from my house in Montlake and walked through
        the university to Aladdin Gyro's up north of 45th on the Ave.&amp;#160; We were going
        to go to Thai Tom but the line was too long. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        We talked about Google, Microsoft and the industry as a whole.&amp;#160; Tip jars, Bush
        and how I should never expect to get social security (I already knew this).&amp;#160;
        He's a good guy who likes to shake things up. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Since everyone wanted to see me wearing my Noogler hat, I had him snap a quick picture
        with my new Canon 20D.&amp;#160; I also grabbed a picture of him. We are both looking
        a little worse for wear from the long walk up there and back. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/photos/NooglerHat-sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Joe Beda wearing his Noogler hat" hspace="0" src="http://www.eightypercent.net/photos/NooglerHat-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/photos/DaveWiner-sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dave Winer" hspace="0" src="http://www.eightypercent.net/photos/DaveWiner-thumb.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you really want to chew up some of my bandwidth (I may have to take this down)
        you can grab the original files (~2MB each) of &lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/NooglerHat-orig.jpg"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net.nyud.net:8090/photos/DaveWiner-orig.jpg"&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        These are jpgs right out the camera.&amp;#160; Be warned that they are shot in the AdobeRGB
        color space so you should really view them in a color space aware application (something
        more like Photoshop and not IE). 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        [Update:&amp;#160; &lt;a href="http://www.freeke.org/ffg"&gt;Dave Walker&lt;/a&gt; suggested I check
        out &lt;a href="http://www.scs.cs.nyu.edu/coral/"&gt;Coral&lt;/a&gt; -- a distributed network
        cache by NYU as a way to reduce the bandwidth hit.&amp;#160; The links above have been
        changed to give that a try.&amp;#160; Post a comment if you have problems.]
