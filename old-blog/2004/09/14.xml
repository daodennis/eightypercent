      <Title>Noogler</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        They call new Google employees Nooglers.&amp;#160; That was what I was last week when
        I was down in Mountain View.&amp;#160; It was a pretty exciting week.&amp;#160; I went to
        some training classes and got my computers set up and such.&amp;#160; I spent quite a
        bit of time working and hanging out with other Googlers.&amp;#160; Everyone was super
        smart and down to earth.&amp;#160; I learned a lot and had a great time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        At the end of the week I got my Noogler hat (propeller on top, of course) at a company
        wide friday event.&amp;#160; I've been digging in this week back in Seattle.&amp;#160; I'm
        hoping that I can get my first checkin in by thursday.&amp;#160; My only job now is to
        write code and ship product.&amp;#160; That is about all I can say too :)
    &lt;/p&gt;
