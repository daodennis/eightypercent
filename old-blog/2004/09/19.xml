      <Title>NY Post article</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Check it the article about Google hiring at the &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/business/30438.htm"&gt;NY
        Post&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; The mention me and this blog but of course don't link to me.&amp;#160;
        This media stuff is pretty crazy.&amp;#160; I don't think that someone like me moving
        around is really that newsworthy.&amp;#160; I'm definitely not as high profile as &lt;a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        One correction:&amp;#160; I wasn't &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; lead developer on Avalon, but rather one
        of many lead developers.&amp;#160; The group is pretty big and my leaving, while I'm sure
        they will miss having me around, won't put the project in jeopardy or anything.
    &lt;/p&gt;
