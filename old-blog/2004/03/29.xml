        Never underestimate the throughput of a pigeon.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        While in New Zealand, we went on a caving trip that included a 100 meter abseil (rappel)
        into a cave and then climbed back out.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;One of&amp;#160;the tour guides&amp;#160;had
        a digital camera in a waterproof housing anchored to his harness.&amp;#160; He took some
        pictures of us on the way down and when we got to the bottom.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The tour operator (&lt;a href="http://www.waitomo.co.nz/"&gt;Waitomo Adventures&lt;/a&gt;) wanted
        pictures from the adventrue to be ready by the time that we returned so that we could
        buy them.&amp;#160; To do this they took&amp;#160;the sony memory stick out of the camera
        and put in in to a little backpack on&amp;#160;a carrier pigeon.&amp;#160; They then let the
        pigeon go and yelled instructions to it on how to get back to the tour office.&amp;#160;
        I think that the pigeon already knew the way, though.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        When we got back (a 20-25 minute trip in a van) the pigeon had arrived and the staff
        back at the office were busy printing out our pictures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://www.waitomo.co.nz/pigeonpix.html"&gt;&lt;img alt="" hspace="0" src="http://www.eightypercent.net/Photos/PigeonPix.jpg" align="baseline" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        We bought the pictures on CD also, but I don't have those with me right now.&amp;#160;
        I'll post those soon so you can see the fruit of the little pigeon's labor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
