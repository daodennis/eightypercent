      <Title>Moving offices</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2004/10/googles-kirkland-office.html"&gt;It's true&lt;/a&gt; --
        Google is opening a development office in Kirkland.&amp;#160; In fact, we are moving tonight
        into our new offices.&amp;#160; So far there has been a small group of us working in some
        temporary offices.&amp;#160; It is going to be nice to move into a more permanent space
        where we can actually talk about work in the hallways! 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Other nice things about moving: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Someone else is going to get and stock the drink fridge.&amp;#160; We've been doing it
            so far by assigning people to make Costco runs. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            We'll have an espresso machine so we can all practice our barista skills. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Conference rooms we can use any time we want. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            We can hang our own art on the walls. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Faster connection to the internet and to Mountain View. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;s&gt;Google colored bean bags everywhere.&lt;/s&gt; Apparently the company that makes the
            google beanbags isn't making them any more. I didn't ask as I assume this is a long
            and complicated story.&amp;#160; Don't worry -- we'll have foosball instead. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Lots and lots of whiteboards. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Stay tuned for more details!&amp;#160; We are planning an open house&amp;#160;party so that
        Seattle knows we are here.&amp;#160; I don't think we can &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/26.html#a8523"&gt;invite
        thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; like Scoble is suggesting -- they just wouldn't fit.&amp;#160;
        Unfortunately I won't be around for the party because I'm going to be out of town
        on a photography trip.&amp;#160; I'm really&amp;#160;disappointed&amp;#160;I'm going to miss it. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
