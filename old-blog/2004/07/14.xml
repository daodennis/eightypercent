      <Title>Photography as protest</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you haven't seen it yet, you should read the sad and scary story of Ian and his &lt;a href="http://www.brownequalsterrorist.com/artiststatement/"&gt;run-in
        with homeland&lt;/a&gt; security at the Ballard Locks here in Seattle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Well, I was driving past the locks yesterday and telling my wife this story.&amp;#160;
        I floated the idea that it would be cool to organize a photoshoot in support of Ian.&amp;#160;
        Well -- I'm behind the curve.&amp;#160; Mykoleary has already &lt;a href="http://www.blueneedle.com/wordpress/archives/2004/07/13/ballard-locks-photo-workshop-sunday-august-1st-2004-1pm-4pm/"&gt;organized&lt;/a&gt; one
        of these on August 1st.&amp;#160; I have to check but I think I may be out of town.&amp;#160;
        I'll be there in spirit at least!
    &lt;/p&gt;
