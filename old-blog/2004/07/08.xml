      <Title>How the TSA tried to kill me</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I recently went to New Zealand.&amp;#160; Since it is an outdoorsy type of place I put
        my camelback water bladder/backpack in my big duffle bag and had a great time.&amp;#160;
        Since I'm a responsible hiker, I have a standard emergency kit in my backpack that
        contains things like a compass, foil space blanket, ace bandage, banana powerbars
        (these are so gross I'll only eat them in an emergency), etc. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Cut to me&amp;#160;going on a hike last Monday and grab my trusty back with the kit already
        put together.&amp;#160; I wanted to put something in my emergency pack and noticed a slip
        of paper from the TSA informing me that they had confiscated my pack of 25 windproof
        matches.&amp;#160; If I had a scanner I would post an image of&amp;#160;the notice.&amp;#160;
        The rule apparently is that knives must go in your checked baggage and matches must
        be in your carryon baggage.&amp;#160; Don't ask me to explain this.&amp;#160; Also don't ask
        me to explain why I can't use my PocketPC to read books during takeoff and landing.&amp;#160;
        These things cannot be explained. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        So, imagine that I had gotten lost in the mountains last Monday and it started to
        get cold.&amp;#160; Normal people would have dispaired and rolled over and died.&amp;#160;
        But not me!&amp;#160; I was a boy scout and was prepared ("Be prepared, its the motto
        of the Boy Scouts!").&amp;#160; I'd reach in to my emergency kit to get my matches to
        start a fire.&amp;#160; Instead of finding life saving matches I would instead find a
        very official looking notice from the TSA letting me know that I'm screwed. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
