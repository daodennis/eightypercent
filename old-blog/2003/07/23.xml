      <Title>I'm not PM, I'm not a PM</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Scoble &lt;a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/07/23.html#a3879"&gt;linked to
        me&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; Thanks dude!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        However, I'm not a PM.&amp;#160; I'm a Dev Lead.&amp;#160; I don't know if everyone knows
        the break down of different jobs at Microsoft, but, in the technical areas, there
        are three main jobs: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/programmanagement.aspx"&gt;Program
        Management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaredevelopment.aspx"&gt;Development&lt;/a&gt;,
        and &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/careerpath/technical/softwaretesting.aspx"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The breakdown goes like this:&amp;#160; PMs talk to customers, develop requirements and
        write specs, Devs implement the code to those specs and Test validates that the Devs
        did their job.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Of course, things never work out that cleanly.&amp;#160; For example, the Test team are
        some of the people first using the product so they may have more and better feedback
        than just if the program works.&amp;#160; And in a techinical area, like what I'm working
        on (graphics and APIs), a lot of the design work can be done by devs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Microsoft is trying to develop higher level individual contributer developers to help
        lead the architecture of the product.&amp;#160; I'm heading down that track right now.&amp;#160; &lt;a href="http://www.simplegeek.com"&gt;ChrisAn&lt;/a&gt; is
        another example of this.&amp;#160; Part of this is that just because you are good at writing
        code doesn't mean that you are good at managing people.&amp;#160; Beyond that, it is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard
        to find PMs that can operate at the technical level necessary for some groups -- such
        as designing windows APIs.&amp;#160; As a result of this, higher level individual contributer
        devs and technical PMs do many of the same jobs.&amp;#160; This is why I've spent that
        last year or so writing specs!
    &lt;/p&gt;
