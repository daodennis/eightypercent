      <Title>Death Valley Photo Workshop</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you are at all interested in photography, you might want to try out a workshop.&amp;#160;
        I went on one to Death Valley last year with Steve Kossack.&amp;#160; He knows the area
        like the back of his hand and runs a great workshop.&amp;#160; You get up before dawn
        to shoot the sunrise, take it easy during the afternoon and then stay up past sunset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/workshops/sk-dv-03.shtml"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;is
        a page describing the upcoming workshop March 4-8.&amp;#160; I'm actually in the first
        picture on that page (second from the left).&amp;#160; If you end up doing it, let Steve
        know I sent you!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      <Title>Home Theater</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you haven't noticed, I've haven't been posting in a while!&amp;#160; I don't know about
        you, but I've been in a little bit of a funk after the PDC.&amp;#160; It was really exciting
        but now it is back to life as usual. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, as a Christmas present for me and Rachel, I'm turning our basement room
        (23'x13'x9') in to a home theater.&amp;#160; We aren't doing anything super elaborate,
        but I figured I'd put out what I'm doing to see if anyone has comments: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Projector: Infocus X1&lt;br /&gt;
        Screen: Home Depot Special DIY&lt;br /&gt;
        Reciever: Yamaha RXV1400&lt;br /&gt;
        Speakers: Axiom M22ti, QS4 and VP150.&amp;#160; SS16 stands.&lt;br /&gt;
        Subwoofer: SVS 20-39PCi (thinking about the PC+)&lt;br /&gt;
        Interconnects (Audio and Video): DIY ala this &lt;a href="http://www.bus.ucf.edu/cwhite/theater/DIYCable.htm"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; 
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Speaker cable: DIY 4x14 guage wire from Parts Express (&lt;a href="http://www.partsexpress.com/pe/pshowdetl.cfm?&amp;amp;DID=7&amp;amp;Partnumber=100-770"&gt;100-770&lt;/a&gt;)
        with screw on banana clips 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        We are planning on getting some new furniture down there along with painting the walls
        and such.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Anyone have any suggestions?&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
