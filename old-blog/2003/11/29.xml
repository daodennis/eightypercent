      <Title>More HT thinking</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Chris -- Thanks for the &lt;a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/c8dae103-c610-4829-bc2d-d9fcb32be084"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; on
        my theater plans.&amp;#160; I really want to come over and see your setup as long as you
        promise me I won't drown.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Chris mentioned Paradigms.&amp;#160; I have a set of Paradigm Reference Studio/40 v2 and
        I love them.&amp;#160; I don't want to take those and repurpose them from my living room
        to my theater so I'm starting over from that respect.&amp;#160; Getting a full HT setup
        with the Studio line is probably more than I want to spend.&amp;#160; However, I've been
        reading good things about the Monitor series.&amp;#160; If I can get a good price on them
        from north of the border, I'll probably do that.&amp;#160; (I was thinking B&amp;amp;W too,
        but I like the sound of my Studio/40s.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        With respect to the Infocus ScreenPlay 4800, that projector is just the Infocus X1
        repackaged for the home theater retail channel.&amp;#160; It costs a good $300 more for
        essentially the same projector.&amp;#160; I think that I'm going to up the ante a little
        bit and I now have a &lt;a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/Sanyo-PLV-Z2.htm"&gt;Sanyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.projectorcentral.com/sanyo_plv_z2.htm"&gt;Z2&lt;/a&gt; on
        order.&amp;#160; This is a much higher resolution (720p native) 16:9 LCD projector.&amp;#160;
        It costs more, but I think that the resolution is going to be worth it.&amp;#160; Supposedly
        the latest round of LCD projectors have the contrast ratio that the DLPs are famous
        for.&amp;#160; Beyond this the Z2 has a DVI input.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I couldn't get the deal on the Yamaha RXV1400 that I thought I could (even though
        I love the idea of a feedback based autocalibration feature) so I'm thinking the Denon
        3803 now.&amp;#160; My current 2ch reciever is a Denon and I'm pretty happy with that.&amp;#160;
        I'll see if I can get a good deal on the 3803.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Beyond that, I'm going to paint the wall or go with&amp;#160;painted fiber board to begin
        with and then look at buying a screen.&amp;#160; I'm not sure what size I want yet!&amp;#160;
        (6.25ftx3.5ft sounds good to start with.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Doing this whole home theater thing is a blast!&amp;#160; There is so much to learn and
        read.&amp;#160; There are tons of good forums and review sites.&amp;#160; The process of just
        figuring out what I'm going to get is a huge undertaking in and of itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
