      <Title>Molly, 1997-2003</Title>
      <Description>
    My guinea pig died yesterday.&amp;#160; We got home from our trip and picked her up from
    the friend that was taking care of her.&amp;#160; She was old (almost 7!) and it was probably
    just her time.&amp;#160; Rachel and I like to think that she waited until we got back
    to give up.&amp;#160; We spent all yesterday crying and dealing with it.&amp;#160; I know
    that it seems silly to cry over a guinea pig, but she was a very sweet pet and we
    loved her.</Description>

      <Title>Back from vacation</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm back from vacation and catching up.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;We picked up a new car at the factory
        in South Carolina and drove it back.&amp;#160; We did a ton of different stuff along the
        way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I got some great images at Yellowstone and I'll try to get some up soon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
