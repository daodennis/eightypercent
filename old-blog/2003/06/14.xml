      <Title>Wireless speed</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I just don't get the excitement around 802.11a and 802.11g standards.&amp;#160; Sure --
        5 times as fast would be nice, but in reality, I'm not using my wireless connection
        for anything that requires faster speeds.&amp;#160; God knows my broadband connection
        can't keep up with 11Mbps.&amp;#160; And if I do (like copying GBs of photos around) I
        just plug in to an ethernet cable. I know, eventually we'll get video on demand and
        all sorts of other high end services over these wireless links.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        802.11b strikes a great balance of speed and range.&amp;#160; The build-out is happening.&amp;#160;
        Why is the press trying to make such a big deal of it?&amp;#160; Or is it not the press
        and there are people who are&amp;#160;really excited about this stuff?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        (10Gb ethernet might be more interesting as this means the network is approaching
        bus speeds.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

      <Title>Watch out for the horns!</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://www.snapple.com/bull/movies/ad_H.wmv"&gt;&lt;img alt="Guinea Pick licking Snapple Bottle" src="http://static.eightypercent.net/images/GPBulls.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        You have to own a guinea pig to appreciate &lt;a href="http://www.snapple.com/bull/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        Make sure you actually wait and watch the ad.&amp;#160; &lt;a href="http://www.snapple.com/bull/movies/ad_H.wmv"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is
        a direct link to the ad video file in wmv format (other formats are available on the
        site).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I was busting a gut on this.&amp;#160; They even say "Moo" at the end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        (Getting that snapshot of the video was a total PITA.&amp;#160; Because of video overlays,
        PrintScreen didn't work.&amp;#160; I had to turn off all of the video acceleration features
        via the display control panel so that the video went through the normal display pipeline.&amp;#160;
        Overlays suck -- and they don't work with a desktop compositor.&amp;#160; &lt;em&gt;Hint, hint&lt;/em&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
