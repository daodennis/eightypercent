      <Title>Apple and 64 bits...</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Just wondering, but does anyone know if Mac OS X actually allows processes to run
        with a full 64 bit address space?&amp;#160; Or is everything just running in a 32 bit
        compat mode?&amp;#160; I couldn't see anything with a quick search on Apple's web page.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        WinNT ran on the 64 bit alpha quite a while ago, but it only ran in a 32 bit mode.&amp;#160;
        Is Apple doing the same thing here?&amp;#160; Is the whole 64 bit thing, wrt Apple, all
        flash and no fire?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        BTW, just because the&amp;#160;new&amp;#160;G5 machines&amp;#160;can have 8GB of RAM doesn't mean
        that an &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; process can access more than 4GB.&amp;#160; Hell,&amp;#160;some
        Intel procs&amp;#160;can access &amp;gt;4Gb, but they are still 32 bit processors.&amp;#160; For
        example, the 32 bit version of W2k3 server can support 32GB of RAM.&amp;#160; This extra
        RAM can be accessed via specialized APIs or you can have, for example, 10 processes
        each using 2GB.
    &lt;/p&gt;
