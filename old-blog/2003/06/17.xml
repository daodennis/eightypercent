      <Title>I hate ticketmaster</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I freakin' hate ticketmaster.&amp;#160; I just had to buy a baseball ticket -- just one
        as we have another person going to the game.&amp;#160; The base ticket price is $16 but
        the total ended up being $22.81.&amp;#160; That is a 43% service charge.&amp;#160; That is
        more than I pay in income tax. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Beyond this, I had to actually use the phone instead of doing it online because I
        wanted to get a seat as close to my other tickets.&amp;#160; In addition to ripping me
        off they: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Asked for my email address to send me confirmation and then asked me if it is okay
            to sign me up to some random&amp;#160;spam list. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to sports illustrated. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Tried to give me a trial subscription to entertainment weekly. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Tried to entice me to some other offer that I didn't catch because the poor guy in
            their phone center was mumbling. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Selling tickets can't be that hard a business to run.&amp;#160; Are these guys just money
        hungry? 
    &lt;/p&gt;

      <Title>What Matrix Persona Are You?</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You are The Merovingian-" src="http://images.quizilla.com/T/trinitykills/1055020378_erovingian.jpg" border="0" /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        You are The Merovingian, from "The&lt;br /&gt;
        Matrix." Wit and danger, with a French&lt;br /&gt;
        twist. You are adamant about the slightly&lt;br /&gt;
        materialistic things- power, wealth, posession.&lt;br /&gt;
        Dominating, aren't we? 
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://quizilla.com/users/trinitykills/quizzes/What%20Matrix%20Persona%20Are%20You%3F/"&gt;&lt;font size="-1"&gt;What
        Matrix Persona Are You?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;font size="-3"&gt;brought to you by &lt;a href="http://quizilla.com"&gt;Quizilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;em&gt;I wouldn't consider myself Senile...&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
