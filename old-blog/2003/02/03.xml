      <Title>Stick a fork in me, I'm just getting started</Title>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Radio screwed the pooch and deleted all of my data.  That kind of put a rush on my own software.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Well, here it is.  It isn't much right now but I can load up my data and generate an index page and RSS feed.  I have to generate the xml files for entries by hand right now, but that will be one of the next things that I implement.  After that, I'll generate an archive.  The last thing I have to do before it will be usable is do an FTP upstreaming solution (similar to Radio, but one that doesn't hang)&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Like I said -- .Net killed the Radio star&lt;/P&gt;</Description>
