      <Title>Calendars considered harmful?</Title>
      <Description>&lt;P&gt;Ha, I just read Michaels &lt;a href="http://michaelw.net/Articles/Idontgettheweblogcalendar.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on why he considers calendars on weblogs useless.  Funny I read this right after implementing mine.
&lt;P&gt;Well, the reason that I did mine is that I want my archives to be reachable in some fashion -- perhaps if only for google.  A search or keyword "related" section would be more usable, for sure.</Description>

      <Title>Cool calendar, huh?</Title>
      <Description>&lt;P&gt;I have a calendar that now points to my archives.  I think that I'm at feature parity with what I was using from Radio, at least with respect to blog generation.  I didn't use any tables in my layout, so let me know if things don't look good in a browser other than IE for windows.
&lt;P&gt;I think that I'm done for tonight.  Next I'm going to work on an FTP upstreamer so that I can just hit a button (or work it on a timer/file system change notification) to upload the site instead of using &lt;a href="http://www.smartftp.com"&gt;SmartFTP&lt;/a&gt; to upload manually.
&lt;P&gt;In some ways this would be a lot easier with a server side solution backed up to SQL server.  I'm tempted to switch over, but I really do like the idea of client side+FTP.</Description>

      <Title>Why no updates?</Title>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/2003/02/16.html#a204"&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; has put me to shame.

&lt;p&gt;To try and redeem myself I have my archives working now.  I also have permalinks.

&lt;p&gt;I haven't uploaded posts in a couple of days as I renumbered all of my entries and I didn't want to screw everyone's Syndirella feed until I had permalinks and guids working.

&lt;p&gt;To see some of the workings behind the scenes, &lt;a href="http://static.eightypercent.net/templates/Main.xslt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the xslt for my main page.</Description>
