      <Title>DSLR for &lt; $1000?</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Canon &lt;a href="http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/eosdigital/index.html"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; the
        new 300D.&amp;#160; The camera itself is ugly, and it is an annoying all flash site, but
        it looks like this could bust things open.&amp;#160; Current prices for DSLRs (the 10D)
        is around $1350.&amp;#160; Dropping this below $1000 could really expand the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm just waiting to read some reviews and see how this is positioned relative to the
        10D.&amp;#160; Reiner and Alice (Reiner is a personality in the NT world) just got a 10D
        and I was playing with it the other day.&amp;#160; It just feels more solid than my D60.&amp;#160;
        I hope that the 10D feels the same way, even though it is covered with chrome crap
        (like the Elan IIe film camera I started with).
    &lt;/p&gt;
