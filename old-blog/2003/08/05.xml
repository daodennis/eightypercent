      <Title>Psuedoscience to the rescue</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Check out &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,59900,00.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article
        in wired.&amp;#160; With a &lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/CodeBlue"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; that
        is a doctror, it always amuses me the capacity for people to think that the "system"
        is hiding the real cure from them.&amp;#160; It seems to me that people always value the
        remedies that they have to go outside the "system" for.&amp;#160; It is like that episode
        of Sienfeld where his dad would only take a gift if it were stolen. Is there a name
        for this phenomenon? 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        (I tried to find the&amp;#160;specific episode for that Sienfeld reference but it turns
        out that there are better episode guides for &lt;a href="http://www.whoosh.org/epguide/"&gt;Xena&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and &lt;a href="http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/GEFP/EpisodeIndex.htm"&gt;Good
        Eats&lt;/a&gt; than I can for Sienfeld.&amp;#160; The web works in mysterious ways.) 
    &lt;/p&gt;
