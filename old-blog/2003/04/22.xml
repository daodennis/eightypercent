      <Title>Back from Death Valley</Title>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;I'm back from my photo trip to Death Valley.  I had a great time, got some great images and met some really interesting people.  I'll put up some of the images tonight after I finish wading through email at work!
&lt;p&gt;Since we woke up before sunrise every day (~4-5am) and stayed out after sunrise followed by dinner I didn't get much sleep.  I'm tired but also recharged.</Description>
