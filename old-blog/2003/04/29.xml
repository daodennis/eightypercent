      <Title>SEA vs. NYY</Title>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;I'm having a blast watching Seattle win against the Yankees.  It isn't over yet but Seattle is leading 4-0 in the bottom of the 6th.  Gil Meche is pitching a great game.
&lt;p&gt;Top of the 7th -- Ms score two more runs.  6-0.  Meche is at 72 pitches and Clemens is already gone at 106 pitches.
&lt;p&gt;Bottom of the 9th and it is still 6-0.  Can the Ms hold on?
&lt;p&gt;Yea!  The Ms shut out the Yankees.  Meche is the man of the match.</Description>
