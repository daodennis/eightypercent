      <Title>Photo gallery software</Title>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;I think I'm going to evolve my blogging software some more over the next couple of weeks.  I want to add the following features:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True WYSIWYG HTML editing.  I'm still writing HTML directly.  I think that I'm going to steal whatever Chris has in BlogX.
&lt;li&gt;Stories.  I want to be able to easily do one-off pages.
&lt;li&gt;Content macro expansion.  I want to be able to name a page or an entry and have a friendly way to refer to it.  Radio does this (I think) by just looking at words in quotes.  I may do the same.
&lt;li&gt;Photo gallery.  Ideally I'd like to be able to dump a bunch of files in a directory and have it create thumbnails and generate gallery pages.  I'd also want a UI for dealing with this stuff:  Ordering files, adding descriptions, etc.  I've been using &lt;a href="http://www.pbase.com"&gt;PBase&lt;/a&gt; for a while now but I think I want a better client side UI.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the UI for JoeBlogger is dead simple.  There is no "save" button.  Just a "New Entry" and an "Upload" button.  There is a calendar control for finding entries and a list for all of the entries for that day.  My goal is to keep it that simple as I add these new features.
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I still plan on finishing the stand alone FTP uploader first!</Description>

      <Title>Dante's View</Title>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a panorama from Dante's View in Death Valley.  We made it up there for this spectacular sunset.  This is a stich of 6 images shot with my 20mm f/2.8 lens on my D60.  It has a horizontal FOV of somewhere around 120 degrees.  Since this is a rectilinear projection, it is equivalent to shooting with a rectilinear 4mm lens.
