      <Title>Winer bugs me...</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I hate New York.&amp;#160; It isn't just the Yankees.&amp;#160; It is the snide attitude that
        nothing else matters.&amp;#160; Dave Winer, today, has an &lt;a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/05/07#When:8:41:06PM"&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; today
        that smacks of the same self-righteousness:&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;"Basically the rule is that success breeds envy, and envy isn't that far
    from hate." &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;
        While I think that this sentiment is true, I think that the bigger reason that people
        hate him is that he is a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=dsm+bipolar&amp;amp;spell=1"&gt;Bipolar&lt;/a&gt; whiner.
        I've never had an email exchange with him where he doesn't take his toys and go home.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        By Dave's own criteria, the only reason people hate Microsoft is because we are so
        successful.&amp;#160; In the ancient &lt;a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; that
        he points to he makes this argument (with BillG) directly.&amp;#160; However, he has changed
        his tune over the last couple of years.&amp;#160; I'm pretty sure that he wouldn't write
        the same thing now.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The "they only hate me because I'm successful" arguement may be some of why MS is
        such a focus for animosity, but I (and a lot of other people at Microsoft) think that
        the problem is deeper than that -- it is one of the ways the company has changed over
        the last couple of years.&amp;#160; 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If Dave really beleives what he wrote, he is guilty of the same hubris of which he
        accuses us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
