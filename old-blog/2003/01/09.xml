      <Title>Let the fun begin...</Title>
      <Description>&lt;P&gt;I've finally beaten radio into submission and have it uploading to my domain.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It uploads in batches of 25 files and for some reason was stalling and taking forever.&amp;nbsp; After tweaking stuff to try to take care of the staling problem it looks like it might be working now...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the end I ended up debugging through the very strange scripting language that they use.&amp;nbsp; It is a&amp;nbsp;wacky mix between a really primitive &lt;A href="http://www.omniscium.com/nerdy/ip/"&gt;intentional programming&lt;/A&gt; (with the outlining) and pascal.&amp;nbsp; The environment for editing and debugging this stuff just seems arcane.&amp;nbsp; This just screams for .Net....&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.Net killed the Radio star..&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</Description>
