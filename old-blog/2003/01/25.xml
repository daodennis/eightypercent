      <Description>There is a MSFT blogger dinner tonight.&amp;nbsp; It should be fun.&amp;nbsp; It seems like more and more people are blogging.&amp;nbsp; There is also a &lt;A href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1114.html"&gt;shindig&lt;/A&gt; happening at Crossroads on Tues.&amp;nbsp; I'll probably try to make it to that one also since it looks to be a much bigger audience.&amp;nbsp; It looks like it is going to be happening at 6pm.</Description>
