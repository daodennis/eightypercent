      <Description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/22#400AMonth"&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;shares that he was surprised that one of his drugs is $400 per month.&amp;nbsp; Just last week I went through the same thing.&amp;nbsp; A drug that I've been taking retails for ~$400 a month.&amp;nbsp; That is over $13 a pill.&amp;nbsp; Every night I take a night out to the movies (well, in 1995) and my insurance pays for it.&amp;nbsp; Online you can find it from US pharmacies for as little as $325.&amp;nbsp; Canadian pharamacies are selling it into the US for $150.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With a wife who is a doctor and a pretty good understanding of economics, I understand why this discrepancy exists.&amp;nbsp; I've also been to &lt;A href="http://www.ruthschris.com/"&gt;Ruth's Chris&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="http://www.elgaucho.com/elgaucho/index_S.html"&gt;El Gaucho&lt;/A&gt; on the drug companies dime.&amp;nbsp; The drug companies are setting themselves up for a peasant uprising.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I didn't notice because the health insurance plan has no copay.&amp;nbsp; The pharmacist kept telling me how lucky we are to have such great insurance.&lt;/P&gt;</Description>
