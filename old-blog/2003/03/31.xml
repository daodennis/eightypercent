      <Title>The latest...</Title>
      <Description>&lt;p&gt;While the work computer is installing the latest version of longhorn...
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Book: &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0399149864&amp;itm=1"&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/a&gt; by William Gibson.  Short review: Not nearly as good as nueromancer -- wait for the paperback.
&lt;li&gt;Book: &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0394555090&amp;itm=1"&gt;Theodore Rex&lt;/a&gt; by Edmund Morris.  This is the followup to &lt;u&gt;The Rise of Theordore Roosevelt&lt;/u&gt;.  After reading both of them, I think that the early life of Roosevelt is more interesting and dynamic.  The detailed description of his years in the whitehouse was something of an anticlimax.
&lt;li&gt;Book: &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0374528497&amp;itm=1"&gt;The Metaphsycisal Club&lt;/a&gt; by Louis Menand.  I just started this and it is heavy going.  However, I like it so far.  It isn't as dynamic (yet) as either of the Roosevent biographies.  I'll summerize after I finish it.
&lt;li&gt;Music: &lt;a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=696998641228"&gt;Scarlet's Walk&lt;/a&gt; by Tori Amos.  This is some of her best stuff since Little Earthquakes.  
&lt;li&gt;Movie: &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0286499"&gt;Bend It Like Beckham&lt;/a&gt;.  I saw this at the Idaho International Film Festival (Bet you didn't know that Idaho had a film festival) and I liked it a lot.  I thought it was clever with some hot women in it.  What's not to like?
&lt;li&gt;Movie: &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0258068"&gt;The Quiet American&lt;/a&gt;.  This 2002 remake of a 1958 film was very moving.  Starring Michael Caine and Brendan Fraser, it details a love triangle set in pre-US involvement Vietnam in the 50s.  Brendan Fraser is so hit or miss -- remember Monkeybone?
&lt;li&gt;Play: &lt;a href="http://www.arbiteronline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/03/20/3e7920b2a19a6"&gt;Icarus&lt;/a&gt; written by Edwin Sanchez and directed by Brian Weaver.  I enjoyed the play a lot -- I haven't been to a play in a while.  I thought the ending was a little bit of a let down.  It was very open ended.
