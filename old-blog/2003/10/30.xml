    &lt;p&gt;
        There are some questions that have been coming up pretty often, so I want to put together
        a series of posts addressing these.&amp;#160; I don't have time to do this now, but I
        wanted to pull together the questions.&amp;#160; Here is what I have so far?
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            SVG vs. XAML?&amp;#160; What up with that?&amp;#160; Why are you guys different?&amp;#160; How
            can I translate stuff back and forth?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Will I get to write pixel shaders?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            What kind of color support are you going to have?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Should I write my custom control using control composition with shapes, or should
            I be overriding Render or should I start creating Visuals?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Are there any others you guys want answered?
    &lt;/p&gt;
