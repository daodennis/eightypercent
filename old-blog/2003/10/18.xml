      <Title>My PDC schedule</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I made the cut and I'm going to be going to the PDC.&amp;#160; Here is the where and when
        of where I'm going to be for sure: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I will be proctoring some of the client "Hands On Labs."&amp;#160; I'll be working Monday,
            Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I'm going to be an Expert at the "Ask the Experts" event on Tuesday night.&amp;#160; I
            don't remember the exact name of the table/room we'll be in, but look for the closest
            thing to Avalon client graphics. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I'll be cheering Greg Schechter on as he presents an in depth intro to Avalon graphics
            at the CLI341 breakout on Tuesday afternoon (3:45-5:00). 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            I'm not scheduled to officially man the Avalon booth, but I'll probably be hanging
            out there some of the time. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Anything else you guys think I should hit?&amp;#160; Some of the "Birds of a Feather"
        sessions look like fun.&amp;#160; The one titled: "Strategic Decisions and Rich Client
        War Stories: Designing today for "Whidbey" and "Longhorn"" looks good along with the
        "VS.NET Secret Tips &amp;amp; Tricks" session.&amp;#160; "What is Windows in an HD World?"
        looks like fun too! 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you want to get ahold of me during the PDC, post a comment to something up here
        or send email to "pdc at bedafamily.com" and we'll figure out a way to meet. 
    &lt;/p&gt;

    day on IE4/5.&amp;#160; I hope she has a fast and full recovery.</Description>
