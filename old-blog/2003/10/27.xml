        We are public!&amp;#160; Ask me what you will.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I've been working on the graphics systems for Avalon for over two years now and it
        is great to&amp;#160;finially talk to people about it.&amp;#160; Let me know what you think
        and if you have any questions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        If you are here, stop by the hands on labs tomorrow or Wed. and say hi.&amp;#160; They
        haven't been that busy yet so I'll have plenty of time to chat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
