      <Title>C++ Standard Libraries?</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Wow -- &lt;a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/05/03/25/2129248.shtml?tid=217&amp;amp;tid=8"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/04/05/23/1737226.shtml?tid=109&amp;amp;tid=185&amp;amp;tid=187&amp;amp;tid=190&amp;amp;tid=201"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        That is always fun.&amp;#160; I'm always amazed at the flow and I love the influx of comments
        both on Slashdot itself and on my blog.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        One comment was from "Dave B" asking me to elaborate on some theories as to why C++
        hasn't developed the same set of libraries that other environments such as Perl, Python,
        Java, C#, etc. have.&amp;#160; Here are a bunch of ideas.&amp;#160; I have no empirical data
        but just gut feeling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        First off, we must examine the philosophy behind different environments.&amp;#160; I may
        be making broad generalizations here, but stay with me:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Java and the CLR (C#, VB.Net): "Make the easy things easy and make the hard things
            possible."&amp;#160; These environments try to avoid the inherit complexity that C++ has.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Python and Perl (and perhaps others that I have no experience with): "Make my life
            easier -- I don't want to spend more time writing this fast and dirty script than
            I have to".&amp;#160; Above all else users here prize being able to get something useful
            done now.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            C++:&amp;#160; "Give me all of the fundamental tools and building blocks and I'll do it
            myself."&amp;#160; Power trumps all.&amp;#160; Templates and the way that people use them
            are a great example of this.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            (I'm sure that there are more categories for things like Lisp and Smalltalk.&amp;#160;
            Filling out that part of the list is left as an exercise to the reader)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        With this difference in philosophy it is no wonder that there is such - ahem - diversity
        in the C++ library space.&amp;#160; Here are some more thoughts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            There *are* good sets of libraries out there for doing stuff.&amp;#160; One example would
            be &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/"&gt;boost&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160; These have limited uptake I think
            for a couple of reasons.&amp;#160; First, downloading and building these is a pain.&amp;#160;
            They don't already come with your compiler.&amp;#160; Second, these libraries are either
            laser focused on a specific area (libtiff?) or are more collections/algorithms base.&amp;#160;
            Boost, for example, doesn't include an easy interface for dealing with zip files or
            for writing a single threaded select loop based network server.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            The C++ standards process is slow and ponderous.&amp;#160; While there are downsides to
            these environments being controlled by a single entity or a focused group, but the
            end result is much faster advancement of the language/runtime/environment.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            There are so many ways to do things in C++ that invariably arguments come up over
            how to do something. Even within one company, people can't agree.&amp;#160; For some reason
            C++ programmers seem to be more stubborn on a lot of these points.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The
            result is that&amp;#160;everyone just writes their own thing.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            It is way to easy to write super hard to use APIs in C++.&amp;#160; Templates make this
            problem worse.&amp;#160; If you do this stuff day in and day out you get to know it and
            it makes sense to you, but most C++ libraries are hard to use on a casual basis.&amp;#160;
            I think that there is a disease where people think that it is their obligation to
            use templates in as confusing a way as possible.&amp;#160; Any time a class has a templated
            base class, you are going to go right over the head of 95% of the developers out there.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Opinions are divided around RTTI and exceptions.&amp;#160; Code written to deal with exceptions
            doesn't interop well with code that turns exceptions off.&amp;#160; Almost no one turns
            on RTTI.&amp;#160; In any case, the result is that these are walls to reusing code.&amp;#160;
            If you don't use exceptions you have to come up with your own error code space or
            use platform concepts like HRESULTs.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Everyone likes to replace their allocator but there is no standard way to do that
            for various libraries.&amp;#160; &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; library lets your replace the allocator it
            is usually something that has to be done on a library by library basis.&amp;#160; So many
            problems would be solved if the CRT and language had a way to do global hooking of
            the malloc/free and new/delete at the link level.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            DLLs, shared libraries, compiler differences, differing STL support all make it harder
            to do things in a standard way.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Windows doesn't have a good standard build system.&amp;#160; The upshot is that libraries
            are only on Unix or the Windows build is cobbled together.&amp;#160; Environments like
            Cygwin are really poor compromises.&amp;#160; It would be better for everyone if the unix
            make/configure systems would be updated to work natively on Windows also. It isn't
            like Windows can change anytime soon without breaking the world.&amp;#160; The MS compilers
            are now free -- the make system is really the only missing part now.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Each codebase has its own way for deciding how header files are included.&amp;#160; Figuring
            stuff like that out is just a headache.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Lots and lots of different string types.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Does this hurt C++?&amp;#160; Probably not -- it is just targeted at a different audience.&amp;#160;
        When you need the power you need the power.&amp;#160; If you have to hunt around for example
        code or a helper library and somehow jam it in to your build system and project then
        that is the price for playing the game.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Just some random thoughts on a Saturday morning...
    &lt;/p&gt;
