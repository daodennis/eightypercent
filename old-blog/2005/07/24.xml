      <Title>Baby: A Programmers View</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm an engineer at heart and I like to understand how things work.&amp;#160; Our new baby, &lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/06/25.html#a244"&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt;,
        is no exception.&amp;#160; Let's take a programmers approach to understanding this mysterious
        black box. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Inputs (the 5 senses): 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Sight &lt;/strong&gt;Anne certainly likes to look around.&amp;#160; My understanding
            is that babies generally see only high contrast at a pretty short distance (1 foot?)&amp;#160;
            She certainly likes looking at faces close up. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Sound &lt;/strong&gt;Whitenoise is supposed to be soothing.&amp;#160; She also likes
            U2 and (heaven help me) Cher.&amp;#160; Loud.&amp;#160; I think she likes my singing too.&amp;#160;
            I'm not sure why. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Taste &lt;/strong&gt;She eats a lot.&amp;#160; I'm not sure how much variation in taste
            she actually gets.&amp;#160; There are theories that the mother's diet can affect the
            milk, but I haven't personally verified that. &lt;em&gt;Ewwww.&lt;/em&gt; 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Touch &lt;/strong&gt;Babies need to be held and touched.&amp;#160; They also need to
            be warm.&amp;#160; One input is swaddling&amp;#160;-- wrapping her tightly so that she can't
            move her arms or legs. Rocking and dancing with her count here too. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Smell &lt;/strong&gt;Smell is supposed to be one of the most powerful senses.&amp;#160;
            I've yet to see her react to any smells specifically, but I'm sure she is paying attention. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Outputs: 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Biological Outputs&lt;/strong&gt; Doctors are funny creatures.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; They
            are really concerned about all forms of matter escaping from our bodies: liquid, solid
            or gas.&amp;#160; Parents also pay close attention to this.&amp;#160; The amount, type and
            origin seem to be important clues to understanding the baby. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Cries &lt;/strong&gt;She has many and varied cries.&amp;#160; Some of them are short
            yelps to draw attention while others are reports of murder nearby.&amp;#160; Then there
            is the scary quivering lower lip.&amp;#160; This is supposedly normal and a byproduct
            of her immature nervous system.&amp;#160; It just kills me to see her do it though. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Posture &lt;/strong&gt;The way she holds her body is an important clue.&amp;#160; If
            she is curled up like a bug or stretched out and rigid means something. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Eyes and Face &lt;/strong&gt;Her eyes and face are very expressive.&amp;#160; Almost
            too expressive.&amp;#160; She goes through a facial expression every 5 seconds or so. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Sleep&lt;/strong&gt; You'd think that it would be easy to tell if she is asleep
            or not.&amp;#160; It really isn't though.&amp;#160; She can be sleeping with her eyes closed
            or just pretending to sleep so that the minute you put her down she perks right up
            again. 
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        There you have it&amp;#160;-- 5 inputs and 5 outputs.&amp;#160; Sounds like a pretty simple
        system to me.&amp;#160; The problem is that she is indeed a very complex state machine.&amp;#160;
        She is so complex that there is no way to map the effect of the inputs (feeding her,
        for example) to the outputs (her current crying state).&amp;#160; One would think that
        it would be easy to empirically derive causal relationships between certain inputs
        and certain outputs.&amp;#160; Nope. She has more states than a Rubik's cube (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube"&gt;43,252,003,274,489,856,000&lt;/a&gt;).
        The baby is indeed a very complex creature that does not yield her secrets to such
        a na√Øve logical approach. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The amazing part is that biology takes over.&amp;#160; My own brain is more complex than
        it can understand.&amp;#160; It has adapted to the baby and somehow we're able make it
        work.&amp;#160; Except when we can't&amp;#160;-- like last night when all of us were up every
        90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      <Title>Debug Firefox build?</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Dear Lazyweb, 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Where can I download a debug version of Firefox?&amp;#160; It just started crashing on
        start for some reason.&amp;#160; I'm sure debug spew would clear it right up.&amp;#160; I
        now I can build my own copy, but I have other things on my mind right now. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Thanks, 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Joe 
    &lt;/p&gt;
