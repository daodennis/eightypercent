      <Title>Back to work</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Monday I start work again after taking three weeks off to spend with the &lt;a href="http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/06/25.html"&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        If I've been slow to answer mail, that is why.&amp;#160; It is amazing how much activity
        she needs.&amp;#160; I had grand plans to get lots of cool stuff done while she was sleeping
        but somehow none of it got done.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        In any case, tomorrow it is back to the salt mines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
