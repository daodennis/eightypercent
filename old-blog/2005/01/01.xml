      <Title>Iron Chef America</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        I'm watching the "Making of" for &lt;a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ia/0,1976,FOOD_16696,00.html"&gt;Iron
        Chef America&lt;/a&gt; right now.&amp;#160; I'm super excited.&amp;#160; From what I've seen it
        looks like they've done a really good translation for the US market.&amp;#160; I'm planning
        on watching the marathon tonight.&amp;#160; I watched the William Shatner special a while
        ago and wasn't all that impressed.&amp;#160; Hopefully this one will be better. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The real clincher for me is &lt;a href="http://www.altonbrown.com"&gt;Alton Brown&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;
        He does the play by play and is the guy doing most of the talking. I've been a huge
        fan of Alton for quite a while.&amp;#160; He is the guy behind Good Eats on the food network.&amp;#160;
        He is really the thinking person's TV chef. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
