      <Title>DVD Review: Yosemite in Winter</Title>
      <Description>
    &lt;p&gt;
        Annie and I watched a DVD this morning while I was feeding her.&amp;#160; Actually, she
        wasn't paying that much attention, but I was.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The DVD was &lt;a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/"&gt;Steve Kossack&lt;/a&gt;'s new DVD documenting
        one of his workshops to Yosemite during the winter.&amp;#160; The DVD is what Steve hopes
        will be first of a series: "&lt;span class="style1"&gt;Steve Kossack: Photographing the
        Great American Landscape."&amp;#160; This one is titled &lt;a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/DVD/index.htm"&gt;"Yosemite
        in the&amp;#160;Winter."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Now that I have the baby, I don't have the time to go on workshops like this, so this
        is the&amp;#160;next best thing.&amp;#160; If you are interested in landscape photography
        at all, this DVD will be of interest to you.&amp;#160; If you haven't been on a photo
        workshop, the video will give you an idea of what one of those workshops is like --
        without the waking up at 4:30 am to hit a sunrise shoot.&amp;#160; If you are planning
        on doing Yosemite on your own, Steve's DVD will provide an invaluable guide to how
        to approach the area and some great places to shoot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        As for Steve himself, I've been on two of his workshops so far (Death Valley and &lt;a href="http://www.stevekossack.com/past_ws/past04.htm#landmarks2"&gt;Landmarks
        of the Southwest&lt;/a&gt;) and both were great.&amp;#160; Steve really knows his stuff -- both
        on the photography side and on the natural and human history of the area.&amp;#160; I've
        never been to Yosemite, but I'd love to go with Steve sometime in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
